As defined in several books about\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/danielnewman\/2015\/02\/17\/marketing-building-a-customer-centric-marketing-eco-system\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customer-centric marketing<\/a>, customer knowledge refers\u00a0<strong>to understanding your customers, their needs, wants and aims<\/strong>\u00a0as essential\u00a0<strong>for aligning your processes, products and services<\/strong>\u00a0in order to build\u00a0<strong>real customer relationships<\/strong>. Since the technology has given customers more power than any of C-suite executives ever had, businesses must do more than just loyalty programs to remain competitive.<\/p>\n<p>Most companies understand the concept of customer knowledge but\u00a0<strong>few of them embrace it<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>For years,\u00a0<strong>insurance companies<\/strong>\u00a0have been focused\u00a0<strong>more on their agent sales force than on their end customers<\/strong>. They have been the ones who set the rules and\u00a0<strong>have their customers play accordingly<\/strong>. Now, the tides have turned and <strong>insurance companies have to rethink their strategy if they want to remain competitive<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>So how can insurance companies start benefiting from their customer knowledge?<\/p>\n<h2>#1 Manage customer knowledge with CRM<\/h2>\n<p>The insurance industry is\u00a0characterized\u00a0by <strong>having a great deal of legacy applications<\/strong> that they use for different processes. These systems are siloed within specific business departments which manage and maintain them on their own.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>This makes it difficult for insurance agents to get a comprehensive and detailed view of the customer<\/strong> and their value to the company. It also makes it hard to get this information to the actual point of contact.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In order to gain customer knowledge and use it to better manage your customers, brokers, and agents, you have to step away from using multiple different systems and <strong>switch to a CRM solution<\/strong>. Having a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.destinationcrm.com\/Articles\/Editorial\/Magazine-Features\/The-Insurance-Industry-A-New-Customer-Policy-46824.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CRM solution<\/a>\u00a0and your data warehouse(s) integrated, you will be able <strong>to reach your goals, improve your customer retention, and lower your costs<\/strong> while improving your overall efficiency. By implementing a CRM solution, you will experience the following benefits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consolidated <strong>customer view<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Improved <strong>growth and retention rates<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Enablement of <strong>multi-channel sales<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Improved <strong>response times and customer satisfaction<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>#2 Use the knowledge to really know your customers<\/h2>\n<p>The CRM will indeed give you a <strong>strategic advantage<\/strong> since you will be able <strong>to track your efforts instantaneously<\/strong>, but it will be of little use if the information in it is not the real reflection of your customers. Before the age of customer, it was enough for you <strong>to know which products were your customers buying<\/strong>. Now, that information is <strong>simply not enough<\/strong>. Insurance industry, as all other, <strong>must truly\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cio.com\/article\/2439055\/managing-customer-knowledge.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">know their customers<\/a>, their needs, lifestyles, and aspirations<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The traditional methods for customer segmentation that worked in what was once a static market with little competition are no longer enough. Demographics such as age and life stage, and source of health insurance do a poor job in giving information on what is driving customers buying decisions. With the whole industry shifting to a more customer-centric model, insurers must find new ways to differentiate themselves from competitors.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>According to a research conducted by\u00a0CMB, most customers have identified <strong>cost, availability and trustworthiness of the insurance company as their most important features regarding insurance products<\/strong> and services. By segmenting your customers based on these findings, you will get a <strong>great amount of customer knowledge <\/strong>and use it to <strong>target different customer segments with tailor-made offerings and personalized messages.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>#3 Improve your customer experience<\/h2>\n<p>In a research conducted by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/us\/en\/financial-services\/publications\/viewpoints\/assets\/fs-viewpoint-insurance-customer-service.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PWC<\/a>, results have shown that leading insurance companies deliver products and services that <strong>match their customers needs and preferences<\/strong> by leveraging <strong>each touchpoint to attract and interact with them<\/strong> in order to build <strong>long-lasting relationships<\/strong>. They achieve it by doing the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Deliver customized experiences<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Leading insurance companies know that their customers differ in their needs, interactions, and preferences. These are then used <strong>to deliver highly personalized experiences, reduce service and product variability<\/strong>, and improve the overall amount of <strong>customer satisfaction<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Integrate communication channels.<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Almost\u00a0two thirds\u00a0of todays insurance customers use <strong>social media to learn more about a product or a service<\/strong>. Simply put, we live in a world of now. There is no more room for paper-based and manual processes when it takes Google only a second to spit out millions of search results. By integrating <strong>different communication channels<\/strong>, <strong>you will provide your customers with continuity of information and an excellent customer service.<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Approach your customers in innovative ways<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Customers have already written a new playbook for the insurance industry and in it they call the shots, not you. In order to play, you have <strong>to know the rules and what better way to learn them than to approach your customers in an innovative way.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the most creative and engaging ways to approach your customers is\u00a0<strong>through customer surveys\u00a0<\/strong>which allow you to <strong>proactively ask for their feedback<\/strong>. By having the answers to your customers needs, not only will you <strong>save time and energy<\/strong>, <strong>you will have an upper hand on both your customers and competitors.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-dc9fd1e1-c77d-4539-bb92-98a69448daac\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-dc9fd1e1-c77d-4539-bb92-98a69448daac\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-dc9fd1e1-c77d-4539-bb92-98a69448daac\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--> <a href=\"http:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/dc9fd1e1-c77d-4539-bb92-98a69448daac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-dc9fd1e1-c77d-4539-bb92-98a69448daac\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/dc9fd1e1-c77d-4539-bb92-98a69448daac.png\" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" \/><\/a> <\/span> <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n\n        hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'dc9fd1e1-c77d-4539-bb92-98a69448daac', {});\n    \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span> <!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Within the last decade, customer knowledge has become\u00a0a significant marketing resource used to support research, promote innovation, and help uncover new market opportunities.
