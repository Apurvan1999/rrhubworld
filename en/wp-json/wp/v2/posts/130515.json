The agency takes care of the strategic, administrative, legal and creative aspects of your influencer marketing campaigns. <\/p>\n<p>On the contrary, if you have a team that is aware of the challenges of digital marketing, there is no need to outsource the design of your strategy. Like <a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report-2020\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">78%<\/a> of marketers, you&#8217;re likely to prefer <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">to manage your influencer marketing campaigns in-house<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hivency.com\/en\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Influencer platforms<\/a> are <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">management, optimisation and analysis tools<\/span> that make this autonomy possible. They save you valuable time by using the powers of machine learning and automating many tasks. An <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">influencer platform provides you with the information and logistical support<\/span> you need to focus on the essential aspects of your campaigns (brief, choice of influencers, analysis of results, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>Do your teams want to benefit from additional expertise without losing control of their missions? Some influencer platforms, such as Hivency, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">offer tailor-made support<\/span>. Our experts (<a href=\"\/en\/influencer-platform-launch-successful-campaigns\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Influence Campaign Manager and Customer Success Manager<\/a>) provide you with <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">personalized advice on the strategic and operational aspects of your campaigns<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/06\/perfect_brief-1.jpg\" alt=\"perfect_brief-1\" width=\"640\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 640px;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\">Photo credit: <span>RF._.studio<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2 -Do you find it difficult to identify influencers?<\/h2>\n<p>Many advertisers struggle <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hivency.com\/en\/your-needs\/find-influencers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to find influencers<\/a> to promote their brand. Only<a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report-2020\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 14%<\/a> of marketers<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> find it easy to find a content creator that fits their campaign<\/span>. Fake profiles are their &#8216;pet peeve&#8217;. In the first half of 2019, mentions of fake influencers were on the rise on social networks, even as the amount of discussion about influencer marketing was decreasing.<\/p>\n<p>If you too are having trouble finding serious content creators, it will be beneficial to turn to an influencer platform. Indeed, this type of service relies on artificial intelligence<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> to analyze a very large number of profiles and the quality of their audience<\/span>. It automatically and accurately identifies credible influencers and weeds out the cheaters. This is an indispensable tool: digital agencies themselves rely on the services of influencer platforms to choose the influencers they work with!<\/p>\n<h3>The influencer marketing industry will be worth <a href=\"\/en\/influencer-marketing-2021-key-points\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">15 million dollars<\/a> by 2022.<\/h3>\n<h2>3 &#8211; Do you prefer macro-influence or micro-influence?<\/h2>\n<p>Macro-influencers are great allies in boosting your brand awareness. <a href=\"\/en\/nanoinfluencers-key-successful-campaigns\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nano and micro-influencers<\/a>, on the other hand, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">enjoy a real proximity with consumers and a genuine power of recommendation<\/span>, synonymous with the act of buying.
