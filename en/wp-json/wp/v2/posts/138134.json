Meaning that the reach and performance of traditional advertising campaigns on these social media platforms will inevitably decrease in the coming months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This revolution in the world of digital marketing is forcing brands to rethink their strategy and build new approaches to promoting their products on social media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution to the fall of advertising? UGC (User Generated Content). Customer reviews, consumer videos, and posts by micro- and nano-influencers are becoming the main vectors for promoting products across all channels (websites, social media platforms, ad campaigns, etc.). Brands are using UGC more and more and this is only the beginning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article takes a look at Meta&#8217;s recent announcements and the new UGC trend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap-1\">Meta launches ad-free subscriptions on Facebook and Instagram<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2023\/10\/facebook-and-instagram-to-offer-subscription-for-no-ads-in-europe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meta has officially unveiled ad-free paid subscriptions<\/a> for Facebook and Instagram. These plans will be rolled out in November in the European Economic Area and Switzerland (31 countries).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the main reason for this new policy? Regulatory compliance. Launching paid subscriptions enables Meta to align with a new European regulation coming into force on March 6, 2024 (Digital Market Act) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap-2\">The impact on consumers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers will have a choice: continue to use Facebook and Instagram for free with ads, or subscribe for an ad-free experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"373\" height=\"825\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-ads-choices.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-138144\" srcset=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-ads-choices.jpg 373w, https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-ads-choices-136x300.jpg 136w, https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-ads-choices-68x150.jpg 68w, https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-ads-choices-27x60.jpg 27w, https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-ads-choices-339x750.jpg 339w, https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-ads-choices-226x500.jpg 226w, https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-ads-choices-362x800.jpg 362w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Ad-free subscription window for Meta<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The monthly subscription price is set at \u20ac9.99<\/strong>. This price goes up to \u20ac12.99 per month if you subscribe on your mobile. This price difference is due to the fees charged by Apple and Google.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subscriptions apply to user accounts, which are identified by an email address.

Brands are facing a new challenge and need to explore new approaches. This is where User-Generated Content or UGC comes into play. Let&#8217;s take a look at how you can turn this seemingly bad news into a more effective acquisition strategy on social media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap-4\">Advertising is dead, long live UGC!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding UGC or User-Generated Content<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>UGC<\/strong>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/what-is-ugc-or-user-generated-content\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">User Generated Content<\/a>, refers to all content created by consumers about a brand or a product. UGC encompasses a wide array of formats, from texts, reviews, ratings, and comments, from consumer photos and videos posted on social media, to Live Shopping sessions\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>UGC is a marketing strategy based on consumers&#8217; authenticity and spontaneity. This is their key strength and the main driver of their success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers see UGC as <strong>more reliable and authentic<\/strong> than traditional marketing messages, creating a relationship of trust between brands and their audiences. This authenticity is particularly valuable today, when consumers are more and more skeptical of traditional ads, and listen even more to peer reviews.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve been preaching the benefits for brands of investing in authentic content, rather than focusing on <strong>ad campaigns with an uncertain ROI<\/strong>, for several years now. Meta&#8217;s news only reinforces this message.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The rising power of UGC<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The rise in UGC is mainly due to changes in consumer behavior. Consumers today are tired of seeing ads everywhere. This advertising fatigue makes brand messages less impactful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, several figures show how important UGC has become in the purchasing process:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>8 out of 10 consumers say that UGC strongly influences their purchasing decisions (Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blogdumoderateur.com\/user-generated-content-enjeux-bonnes-pratiques-exemples-strategies-ugc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Blog du Mod\u00e9rateur<\/a>).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>88% of consumers check the product reviews before making a purchase.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>UGC publications generate 6.9 times more engagement on social media platforms than brand publications.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>UGC is based on authentic and relevant content, which is an increasingly decisive factor for consumers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing UGC means opting for a more authentic and collaborative marketing style, that is more in tune with consumer expectations and, ultimately, more effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3 benefits of using UGC for brands<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands benefit in several ways by adopting UGC:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>UGC generates trust<\/strong>: using UGC is a powerful way of showing that the brand accepts both positive and negative feedback. This builds a relationship of trust with consumers, demonstrating that the brand values and respects all its customers&#8217; opinions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>UGC generates engagement<\/strong>: UGC gets users actively involved with the brand. It fosters the creation of an engaged community. This ongoing interaction between brands and their audiences via UGC strengthens their relationship and can turn consumers into brand ambassadors.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>UGC boosts conversion<\/strong>: UGC has a direct impact on sales. As discussed above, it plays a key role in the buying journey. UGC is authentic, influencing consumer purchasing decisions more than traditional ads. By leveraging user-generated content, you can reduce your marketing costs while increasing your sales. The result? A much higher ROI than traditional advertising campaigns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4 tips for shaping your UGC marketing strategy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several steps to follow when defining a UGC-focused marketing strategy on social media.

Meanwhile, here are 4 tips for building your strategy:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Define and prioritize your goals<\/strong>: do you want to increase engagement? Promote your products?
