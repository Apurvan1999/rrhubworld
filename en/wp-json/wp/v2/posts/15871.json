This is <strong>the most visible<\/strong> place at the operational level, and often the one that consumers remember when they decide to become loyal customers or abandon for a competitor. This is sometimes <strong>the only point of direct contact<\/strong> between your customers and your organisation, hence its crucial importance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-service-1.jpg\" alt=\"customer-service\" class=\"wp-image-19382\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you give customer service the attention it deserves, or do you tend to neglect its value to the business?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to focus properly on customer service, here are the seven most important things you need to remember:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">1 &#8211; Your customer service must know your company organisation and product<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The mistake<\/strong> many companies make is to <strong>hire employees<\/strong> who are <strong>unfamiliar with the subject<\/strong> of their business. Customer service representatives have a document on their desk with repetitive and recycled information that they will use to respond to customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to make sure that the employees in your customer service <strong>know your brand, the company, and its activities<\/strong>. This is the only way that will enable them to effectively answer questions, solve problems and deliver value to their actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\">2 &#8211; Be Proactive with your customers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You cannot wait for customers to come to you. Your goal should be to <strong>go and find customers<\/strong> and identify everything you can do to <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/data-and-rights-management\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>improve their experience<\/strong><\/a> with your brands, products or services.

While some traits come naturally, <strong>others can be taught and perfected<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/training-customer-service.jpg\" alt=\"training-customer-service\" class=\"wp-image-19387\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, think of the &#8220;symmetry of attentions&#8221;: your customer service agent will be more attentive if they feel they are being listened to.
