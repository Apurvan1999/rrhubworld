If you want to engage your respondents and keep them focused, you have to make things as easy as possible for them.&nbsp;<\/span><span lang=\"FR\">Good sequencing makes your survey much smoother<\/span><span lang=\"FR\">&nbsp;because each question leads on to the next.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span lang=\"FR\">If you jump from one subject to another, some respondents may give up and not complete your survey. It is essential that the questions link together and unfold smoothly.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span lang=\"FR\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\"><span lang=\"FR\">Rule n\u00b02: Ensure Your Surveys Are Coherent<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span lang=\"FR\">You need to take a step back for this second rule.&nbsp;<\/span><span lang=\"FR\">Your questions should flow smoothly and coherently, but there should also be a logic behind your survey as a whole.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span lang=\"FR\">There\u2019s an easy way to ensure that your survey is coherent: try to give it a title.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><p><span lang=\"FR\">For example:&nbsp;\u201cWhat do you think of our customer service?\u201d&nbsp;or&nbsp;\u201cWhat do you think of the new version of our X product?\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-22350\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/mobile-survey.jpg\" alt=\"mobile survey\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>If you can\u2019t give your survey a title, then it probably covers too many topics and is asking unrelated questions.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\n\n\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>A coherent survey is a \u201cspecialised\u201d one<\/strong>. At Skeepers\u00a0<a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/cx-management-en\/\">CX Management<\/a>, we recommend using thematic surveys. If you want to ask your customers about several different subjects, create several surveys rather than one catch-all survey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\n\n\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Rule n\u00b0 3: Ensure Your Surveys Develop and Progress Properly<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\n\n\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Your surveys should develop gradually, like a novel. There are several ways to do this. But generally,\u00a0<strong>a survey should develop by moving from the simplest to the most complex question, the most general to the most technical, the most impersonal to the most personal.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\n\n\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This progression should be clear in your surveys. For example, if you want to rate your customers\u2019 satisfaction with your delivery service, you could start with a generic question, such as: \u201c<em>Were you satisfied with your last delivery?<\/em>\u201d (this question also helps build your CSAT satisfaction indicator).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\n\n\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You can then ask several more specific questions to get more detailed feedback. For example, questions about delivery time, delivery conditions, quality of packaging, quality of tracking, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><p>You can end your survey by asking a question to build your&nbsp;<strong>Net Promoter Score (NPS)<\/strong>:&nbsp;<em>\u201cWould you recommend our service to others?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-22351\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/surveys-cx-management.jpg\" alt=\"surveys cx management\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You can also ask one or more personal questions at the end to find out more about your customers themselves, as opposed to only what they think about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\n\n\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Rule n\u00b04: Ensure Your Surveys Follow Your Customer Experience Steps<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\n\n\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Whether you want to assess a product or service, the order of your questions should reflect the chronological order of your\u00a0<a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2007\/02\/understanding-customer-experience\">customer experience<\/a>. For example, to evaluate your customer service, you could unfold your questions in this order:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\n\n\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">How did you contact our customer service?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">How easy was it to reach our customer service?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">How would you describe the person who handled your request?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Were our operator\u2019s questions clear enough?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\n\n\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Was our operator able to solve your problem?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In general, how would you rate our customer service\u2019s responsiveness?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-22352\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/cx-management-surveys.jpg\" alt=\"cx management surveys\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><p>If the survey is about rating a product, you should ask questions in a logical order, from understanding to using the product. For example, for high-tech products, it\u2019s best to start by evaluating the product\u2019s exterior (design, weight, size) and then its features.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap5\">Rule n\u00b05: Ensure Your Surveys Are Adapted to Your Respondents\u2019 Profile<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This might seem obvious, but you wouldn\u2019t ask men what they think about personal hygiene products for women. There is no point sending a survey to rate a product to people who have never bought or used it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More generally speaking,&nbsp;<strong>you should ensure that your surveys are addressed to people who are likely to be able to answer the questions. This is an obvious and intuitive rule that serves as a reminder of the importance of targeting surveys.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><p>A survey rarely applies to your entire database. The most efficient surveys are those that target a specific segment of your clientele and that deal with a specific theme \/ experience. To create this type of survey, we recommend using customer knowledge solutions that are adapted to your needs.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap6\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Never underestimate the importance of logic in a survey. Following these rules will make your surveys easier to complete for respondents, by creating a smoother and more straightforward experience. A survey\u2019s logic also impacts the quality of the answers collected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\" id=\"hs-cta-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/20304540\/cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" height=\"159\" width=\"700\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a.png\" alt=\"Discover our Solutions: Book your Demo\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(20304540, 'cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a', {\"useNewLoader\":\"true\",\"region\":\"na1\"}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How coherent and organised your surveys are impacts your response rate and the quality of the answers you collect.
