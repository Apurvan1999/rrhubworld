Bridging the world of alchemy and biology for functional benefits, what started from her kitchen has evolved into a cult favorite, plant-sourced alchemy brand that brings unstress rituals to feed your calm.<\/p>\n<h3>The Challenge<\/h3>\n<p>Bianca Bolouri, Chief Marketing Officer at Moon Juice, says the brand first reached out to Octoly for help with authentic review seeding on Sephora to truly showcase the results of using Moon Juice products. \u201cBeauty Wellness is a relatively new category and as leaders in the space, it&#8217;s important consumers have a chance to see reviews from their peers. Everything to how consumers use the products the lasting effects they\u2019ve seen in their skin, hair, mood, and brain.<\/p>\n<h3>The Solution<\/h3>\n<p>Using the Octoly platform for review seeding, Moon Juice was able to target the right customers. \u201cIt was imperative that we were working with customers who were looking for targeted results so that their insights would be valuable to consumers looking to enter the category or expand within the category. For their Super Hair product specifically, Moon Juice partnered with Octoly to send products to customers who dedicated six weeks or more to take the supplements before leaving the reviews. \u201cAllowing for the right length of time for customers to try the product, make it a ritual and see the benefits is the only way with supplements to have a real impact, there is no quick-fix solution.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>The Results<\/h3>\n<p>With Octoly, Moon Juice was \u201cvery successful\u201d in seeding authentic, detailed <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.octoly.com\/the-best-strategy-for-your-customer-review-campaign\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reviews<\/a> on Sephora and in turn has seen a lift in conversion. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve had great results and we&#8217;re excited to kind of see the continued growth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She says Moon Juice is \u201clooking forward to continuing to partner\u201d with Octoly.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Campaign Results Across 7 SKUs<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">650<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Units sent<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">615<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Total Reviews<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">96%<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Would Recommend<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">4.6\/5<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Star ratings<\/h4>\n<p>\u201cAuthentic ratings and reviews is truly the foundation for success whether on a brand site or a third-party retailer.
