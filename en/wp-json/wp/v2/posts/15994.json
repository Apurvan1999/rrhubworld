There are Smart Survey options that enable you <strong>to create custom questions for your customers and specifically target them to get useful information<\/strong> on why they use your product, what they would like more of, how they feel about your company culture, and what you can do better.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;height: 384px\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/ces-kpi-satisfaction_0.jpg\" alt=\"manage dissatisfied customers\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This information is invaluable when creating marketing campaigns, considering new product ideas, and trying to connect with your customers in more sincere and authentic ways.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of times, marketers try to guess what their customers want without doing the research.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Not only does this not help accomplish your marketing goals, it can actually be detrimental to them. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you are marketing to the incorrect audience, you can waste valuable resources on confusing and counterproductive content.<\/p>\n<p>Your actual customers will think that your product doesn\u2019t apply to them. Your incorrectly targeted market will give your product a chance, and then be disappointed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s better for everyone to market to the right people, the right way, the right time.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Building a Customer Knowledge base<\/h2>\n<p>Not only customers are more <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/customer-feedback-surveys-myths\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">open to giving feedback than you may think<\/a>, but oftentimes, they demand it.<\/p>\n<p>Customers like feeling like there is a platform for them to speak their mind.<\/p>\n<p>Successful companies know this, and go out of their way <strong>to make feedback constantly available for their clients<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Starbucks has a customer feedback link available right <a href=\"https:\/\/customerservice.starbucks.com\/app\/contact\/ask_retail_stores\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on their website<\/a> where customers\u00a0 can leave messages regarding an experience they had at any store.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 700px;height: 407px\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG-Starbucks.png\" alt=\"starbucks customer feedback management\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Note that in this survey, the personal information of the customer is taken down.<\/p>\n<p>This is because this information should always be entered into a database so that it can be referenced and <strong>so that these customers can receive follow-up regarding their feedback<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, <strong>it makes customers happy to be able to give feedback<\/strong>, but only if they feel that the feedback is being listened to and needs change.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 677px;height: 450px\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG-PDG.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Discover <a href=\"http:\/\/get.myfeelback.com\/lp-ebook-top-fortune-500-en\">How Top Fortune 500 Companies Increased their Performance using Customer Feedback<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon<\/a> is another example of a company <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/customer-centric-lessons-amazon\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">who does a great job with feedback<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We are all familiar with Amazon\u2019s product reviews, but these reviews are actually reviewing the products sold on Amazon, not about their interaction with Amazon itself.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon offers a survey regarding customer satisfaction on their webpage that is easily accessible, user friendly, and efficient.<\/p>\n<p>It gives customers enough space <strong>to voice their concerns and provide positive or negative feedback<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 700px;height: 366px\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG-Amazon.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These big companies know that giving your customers a platform and making their voice heard is <strong>the key to providing a great customer experience<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>From Customer Knowledge to Customer Experience<\/h2>\n<p>If you go about it the right way, you can simultaneously <strong>gain essential customer knowledge<\/strong> and <strong>find brand ambassadors<\/strong> amongst your current customers.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard enough to get customers to express concern when the lines of communication are open.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine how many customers you will lose if you don\u2019t reach out and ask for feedback actively and constantly.<\/p>\n<p>Remember: <strong>Customer experience is all about making the customer feel important, prioritized, and valued<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>When you receive the responses to a survey, the most important next step is properly <strong>organizing the responses you receive and correctly analyze them <\/strong>to create a great customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>Getting data is great, but <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/custom-reporting-data-tips#sm.0000e1axsa1ckre2jq27liw702ftq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what you do with that data<\/a> really decides if it will take your company to the next level.
