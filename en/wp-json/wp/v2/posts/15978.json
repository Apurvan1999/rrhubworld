Over the past few years, customers have rapidly become <strong>cross channel customers<\/strong>, meaning they use <strong>multiple communication channels to interact, communicate, and purchase<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, in order to keep up, when measuring customer satisfaction, you need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.retailtouchpoints.com\/in-store-insights\/3160-analyzing-the-customer-experience-to-drive-cross-channel-growth\">develop a cross channel strategy<\/a>\u00a0for collecting customer data in order to stay relevant and effective. Just like you use multiple channels to sell your product, you need <strong>multiple channels to get feedback on it<\/strong>. Here are our tips for how to reach your customers on multiple communication channels and <strong>get the most accurate information and the best feedback possible.\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Why do you need to measure your customer satisfaction across channels?<\/h2>\n<p>Now that connecting through technology is the new norm, companies are paying close attention to the importance of measuring customer satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p>In an economic climate of a strong competition, customers are more likely to be picky and flip back and forth between brands. This means that unsatisfied clients can quickly lead to churn and a low retention rate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Check out\u00a0this blog post for more information on <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/why-business-needs-analyze-customer-satisfaction\/\">Why your company should be measuring customer satisfaction<\/a>,\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The most useful tool for measuring customer satisfaction is without a doubt\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/feedback-surveys-grow-your-business\/\">the survey<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 299px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/example-survey-computer.jpg\" alt=\"example-survey-computer\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Technology allows companies to take advantage of immediate surveys, or surveys that are sent out after a specific interaction with a customer, like a delivery, a phone call with customer support, or a product order. These surveys allow you to <strong>develop a continuous exchange of feedback with your customer<\/strong> and are therefore extremely useful in collecting customer knowledge. Not only that, but <strong>immediate surveys are shorter <\/strong>than general surveys and allow you to<strong> get a better response rate.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>What channels are my customers using?<\/h2>\n<p>Today there are multiple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.interaction-design.org\/literature\/article\/customer-touchpoints-the-point-of-interaction-between-brands-businesses-products-and-customers\">touchpoints of interaction between a business and customer<\/a>. In this way, most companies are already multi-channel. Your customers can order products on your website or come into the store to buy it in person. And then, if they have a problem, they can come to the store, or <strong>they can reach out to you by email, phone, even social media<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>This shows how you are making sure to offer them <strong>multiple methods to get in touch with you<\/strong> because you want to make <strong>their experience as pleasant as possible.<\/strong> Measuring how well this is working can help you see where you are succeeding, and where you need to put in more effort.<\/p>\n<p>If your clients generally use more than one communication channel in order to complete actions related to your business, then they are cross channel.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 428px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/cross-channel-behaviour.jpg\" alt=\"cross-channel-behaviour\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you want to measure the quality of your customer experience, and your customer satisfaction in general, <strong>you need to do it on multiple channels of communication.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>If you need help creating a customer feedback survey, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/ultimate-guide-creating-customer-survey\/\">our guide<\/a> here.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cross-channel customer satisfaction measurement allows you to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gain more customer data<\/strong>.

There are a lot of different factors that go into this decision.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, <strong>you should clearly identify all the points of contact between your company and your customers<\/strong>: your website, email, sales outlets, telephone, sms, mobile applications, and social networks.<\/p>\n<p>It is obvious that you can only distribute your survey on the channels used by your company. Meaning that if you do not have a mobile application, your cross-channel measurement strategy will not integrate this channel.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mycustomer.com\/experience\/engagement\/mapping-your-customer-journeys-across-touchpoints-examples-and-techniques\">The mapping of your channels of communication<\/a> is the first step in the implementation of a strategy for measuring cross-channel customer satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p>3 main parameters have to be taken into account to choose the right channel to measure customer satisfaction:<\/p>\n<h3>The level of use of each channel by your customers<\/h3>\n<p>If you only have 50 Facebook followers, this channel won&#8217;t be the most relevant to collect opinions and measure satisfaction. You should focus on the channels your customers use the most regularly when they interact with your brand.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you have a lot of brick and mortar stores and this is still the main way that customers interact with you, then satisfaction should be measured in-store. It can still be on a computer, just make it available inside the store.<\/p>\n<h3>What you want to measure and the length of the survey<\/h3>\n<p>Long surveys are difficult to disseminate on mobile phones. However, texting is a great option if you want to get a large response rate for a short survey, like a <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/recover-failing-business-with-nps-survey\/\">Net Promoter Score question<\/a>\u00a0and collecting an email to open a new channel.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 503px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/survey-conversational-sms.png\" alt=\"survey-conversational-sms\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>The profile of your customers<\/h3>\n<p><strong>\u200b<\/strong>The younger your customers are, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pewinternet.org\/fact-sheet\/social-media\/\">the more relevant social networks are<\/a> and the more you should be prioritizing and monitoring them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG-customerprofile.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The objective of measuring cross channel satisfaction is to be able to collect continuous feedback on your various channels.\u00a0<strong>In MyFeelBack, each survey can be deployed on the channels of your choice simultaneously<\/strong>: whether it be website, email, text, social networks, or a mobile app.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>If you want to be a relevant business, you cannot market on one communication channel anymore. By the same token, you cannot collect feedback on one channel either. Customers express themselves in a myriad of different ways, and this often depends on which channel they are using to communicate. <strong>The more channels you open up for your customers to communicate on, the more authentic, helpful feedback you will receive.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-fe084c73-3009-4584-9202-61f865b104c7\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-fe084c73-3009-4584-9202-61f865b104c7\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-fe084c73-3009-4584-9202-61f865b104c7\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/fe084c73-3009-4584-9202-61f865b104c7\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-fe084c73-3009-4584-9202-61f865b104c7\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/fe084c73-3009-4584-9202-61f865b104c7-1.png\" alt=\"download the customer satisfaction ebook\" \/><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'fe084c73-3009-4584-9202-61f865b104c7', {}); \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For a business to succeed, it has to adapt to the evolving behavior of its customers.
