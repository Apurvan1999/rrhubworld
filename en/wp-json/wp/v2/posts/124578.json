Not a typical tanning brand, Isle of Paradise uses color-correcting technology and natural actives to create an all-vegan brand that champions self-confidence, self-love, and self-care. From being the first self-tanning brand to feature a plus-size model in its debut campaign, to founder Jules Von Hep\u2019s continued advocacy of self-confidence and self-acceptance, Isle of Paradise is shaking up the tanning industry for all skin tones and types.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Challenge<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a growing following across social media for their already established inclusive and positive messaging, Isle of Paradise approached Octoly to connect the brand with micro-influencers on TikTok to create strong before and after content of their bestselling, Self-Tanning Drops. Organizing this content had previously been a difficulty for the brand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cGarnering strong before and after content for self-tan products can be tricky,\u201d explains Noelle Cantarano, VP of Marketing &amp; Innovation at Future Beauty Labs. \u201cBecause there\u2019s still a stigma stuck to the category, we\u2019re working to re-educate and show just how revolutionary Isle of Paradise products are.\u201d While the product is their number one SKU, the brand wanted to focus on creating TikTok content with Octoly in the hopes of driving increased brand awareness as well as sales and volume outside of peak summer months.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Results<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re on TikTok, chances are you\u2019ve seen the Isle of Paradise Drops go viral. The<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@puertoricanma93\/video\/6922485847883369734?source=h5_m&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v2\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#WakeUpAndGlow hashtag<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> currently has 2.4 million views and the before and after content created with Octoly influencers generated ongoing buzz and awareness that fueled a significant sales increase for this product through Q4.The campaign has also been covered by<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vogue.co.uk\/miss-vogue\/article\/tiktok-beauty-products\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vogue<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> under \u201cTikTok-approved beauty products.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe were thrilled to see a significant uptick in Sephora sales of our hero sku following our campaign and we are also seeing Isle of Paradise trending on TikTok, with new videos surfacing daily keeping the brand top of mind,\u201d said Noelle Cantarano. \u201cOverall, we&#8217;re extremely pleased with the results, which blew the benchmarks out of the water.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe key to the success of the campaign\u2019s before and after content was the authenticity created by using Octoly\u2019s micro-influencers,\u201d says Erika Borst, Influencer Marketing Coordinator at Future Beauty Labs. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that the return on investment with micro-influencers is impactful and authentic,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone is now saying, to us \u2018TikTok made me buy it.\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>The Solution<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Octoly worked with Isle of Paradise to connect the brand with micro-influencers for the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/wakeupandglow?source=h5_m&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v2\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#WakeUpAndGlow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> campaign on TikTok, breaking the barrier of entry into self-tan products by creating short-form video tutorials. The videos ran in conjunction with a TikTok ad campaign directing customers to Sephora,<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@bethanyau_\/video\/6892129942289550597?source=h5_m&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v2\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demonstrated how to apply the product<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and showed<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@elinaevanss\/video\/6898368146034445570?source=h5_m&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v2\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the result after leaving the product overnight<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. By using micro-influencers, Octoly could provide viral authentic before and after content and TikTok was the perfect platform for these fun, engaging, and educational videos. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isle of\u00a0Paradise has since used some of the content created by Octoly influencers across their social channels, sharing the videos on Instagram. They also have begun to contract some of Octoly\u2019s talent to create content for ads and are currently leveraging Octoly to support new product and retailer launches for multiple brands within their portfolio.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The results in 3 months<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Influencer\u00a0 \u00a0 Posts<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">257<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">VIEWS<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">3.4M<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Interactions<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">86K<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">ENGAGEMENT<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">4.65%<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cThe key to the success of the campaign\u2019s before and after content was the authenticity created by using Octoly\u2019s tiktok influencers.
