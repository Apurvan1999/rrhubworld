The number of participants is therefore a variable of success.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use your communication channels to promote your live events and ensure that as many people as possible join in:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Website<\/strong>: e.g., Micromania, one of our <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/live-shopping\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">live shopping solution clients<\/a>, displays banners on its site with a countdown to the event. It also has a direct shopping page on its website.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Social media<\/strong>: use social network platforms to engage your community.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Emails &amp; SMS<\/strong>: send emails and SMS\u2019 to your contact base.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stores.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/0.1-1024x478.png\" alt=\"Micromania website - Live Shopping - RR Hub World\" class=\"wp-image-121177\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Live shopping tab on Micromania\u2019s website<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.monoprix.fr\/corner\/liveshopping\/shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Monoprix<\/a>, another of our clients, rolls out a <strong>360 media plan<\/strong> to promote live events on social media: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monoprix also allocates a media budget to target people with an interest in its live event\u2019s theme: women, magazines, home and living magazines, etc. You can <strong>boost your events\u2019 visibility<\/strong> with sponsored articles and ads.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By promoting live events outside of organic channels, brands can capture new customers with an interest in your live shopping topics.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\"><strong>2 \u2013 Get the Timing Right<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to <strong>identify the best time and day <\/strong>to host a direct shopping session. This can significantly impact the number of participants and conversion rate.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, after trying out several time slots, Monoprix settled on Tuesday evenings as the best time to reach its target (urban upper socio-professional groups) and optimize participation and engagement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend trying a few different time slots, based on your target audience\u2019s characteristics, requirements and preferences, to quickly identify the best schedule.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\"><strong>3 &#8211; Choose the Right Channels<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of our clients ask us which the best live shopping channels are. It depends on the brand but, generally speaking, there are 3 types of channels:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your website<\/strong>. We recommend creating a live shopping page on your website. This page should include your live sessions, as well as all of your previous events (and those to come).&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>YouTube<\/strong> <strong>and Twitch<\/strong>. YouTube and Twitch are ideal for direct shopping. Twitch is becoming more and more well-known and brings together large communities with its video and live chat features.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Social media<\/strong>. Not all platforms are suitable for direct shopping. TikTok, for example, encourages users to scroll through short videos, which isn\u2019t ideal for direct shopping. Instagram, on the other hand, is probably the best suited for live shopping with its Explore and Shop pages.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\"><strong>4 &#8211; Foster Authenticity and Conviviality to Increase Retention Rates<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Direct shopping retention rates are much higher than those in-store or on an e-commerce product page. <strong>A live shopping participant spends on average 10 minutes watching a product demo!<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how can you increase your viewer retention rate? By creating engaging direct shopping events. How can you maximize engagement? By fostering authenticity and conviviality. <strong>Live shopping should not be monotonous, like teleshopping, or a slick commercial.<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Direct shopping is all about community, conviviality, participation, and dialog. It can help achieve both relationship (bringing together a community of customers, enhancing the customer relationship) and transactional objectives. Live shopping <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/humanize-customer-journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>humanizes the<\/strong><\/a><strong> digital customer journey <\/strong>and adds a human touch to the act of purchasing online.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap5\"><strong>5 &#8211; Use Gamification to Optimize Your Conversion Rate<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s great if participants watch your live session and share their enthusiasm with likes, but you want them to buy the products too!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to encourage participants to buy is gamification: limited time <strong>promo codes<\/strong>, <strong>exclusive deals<\/strong>, etc. You can also explore other mechanics, such as <strong>giveaways <\/strong>or <strong>lucky draws<\/strong>. Gamification makes live sessions more fun, improves the quality and increases retention.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.micromania.fr\/live-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Micromania<\/a> organizes about 10 draws per live session with very good results!\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand also always offers promo codes, as you can see below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/1-1024x482.png\" alt=\"Live Shopping - RR Hub World - micromania\" class=\"wp-image-121149\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Live shopping on Micromania\u2019s website<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>A banner on Micromania\u2019s website displays these promo codes to encourage visitors to join the live event.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/2.24-1024x141.png\" alt=\"Banner - micromania - web site - skeepers\" class=\"wp-image-121156\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Live Shopping banner on Micromania\u2019s website<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Presenting flagship products or new launches is also a good way to increase conversion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Live Shopping: High Conversion Rates<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that live shopping conversion rates in Europe average between 10 and 12%? And that they can go much higher? For example, Monoprix\u2019s conversion rates go up to 30%!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These rates remain lower than in Asia, of course, where direct shopping is more firmly entrenched and can reach up to 60%. But remember, the average conversion rate for a traditional online store is around 2%.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap6\"><strong>6 &#8211; Use Live Shopping Video Replays<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the magic of replay to extend your live shopping sessions, so that consumers can watch or rewatch past events anywhere, at any time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend creating a direct shopping page on your website, listing all of your past sessions.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monoprix\u2019s live shopping replay page has 10% more views than its Clothes or Home &amp; Leisure pages. Some Monoprix replay videos have been viewed more than 10,000 times! It would be a shame to miss out on this extra exposure\u2026&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of a direct shopping web page (belonging to one our clients, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ikks.com\/fr\/live-shopping-party.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IKKS<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/3.24-1024x473.png\" alt=\"Live shopping page - IKKS - Skeepers\" class=\"wp-image-121163\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Live shopping page on IKKS website\u00a0<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also add replay videos on your <strong>product pages<\/strong> to enhance them and <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/boost-website-conversions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">boost <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/boost-website-conversions\/\">conversion<\/a> rates.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap7\"><strong>7 &#8211; Invite Celebrity Guests to Appear in or Co-Host Your Live Shopping Sessions<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of brands use in-house hosts: employees, sales reps, product managers, marketing execs, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting employees involved, as opposed to professional hosts, is often a great idea; it makes your sessions more authentic. Employees also have a good knowledge of your products.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why not <strong>invite celebrity guests and experts<\/strong>? Monoprix\u2019s live shopping sessions are hosted by specialist journalists.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We strongly recommend <strong>co-hosting live shopping sessions with influencers<\/strong>. You will attract communities who don\u2019t necessarily know or buy from you and increase the number of participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Micromania has teamed up with TV host Alex Goude, who is also a gamer, to present its new products and deals. Each live attracts on average 30,000 viewers (including replays).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/4.24-1024x538.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-121170\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Micromania live shopping<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap8\"><strong>8 \u2013 Optimize Your Mobile Device Experience&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This might sound a bit technical, but it\u2019s worth a mention.

Approximately 80% of viewers, in fact. <strong>It is paramount that you display your live sessions properly on mobile devices.<\/strong>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Monoprix first began live shopping in 2021, it tried out a direct shopping solution that couldn\u2019t stream vertically.
