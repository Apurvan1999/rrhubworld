But just as importantly as converting visitors into customers, marketers need to be on the lookout for making sure that customers<em> stay <\/em>customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dormant customers are a bummer for any business, and it&#8217;s important as CMO to create a strategy that successfully awakens these sleepy buyers and gets them back interested in your product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of techniques that you can use to try and catch the interest of dormant customers. One of the most effective ways is to get them talking. A great way to do this is through sending out a survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a marketer, surveys are useful for a myriad of reasons, and hopefully you are already using them to track your customer satisfaction and gain insight into your <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/7-kpis-to-measure-your-customer-experience-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">customer experience<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a specific survey targeted to your dormant customers can be a great way to get them to express what interests them, and give you an idea why they haven&#8217;t been buying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three main things you should focus on when sending out a dormant customer survey: A snappy subject line, solid questions that give insight to any problems, and an offer at the end.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\">Choosing the right subject line when you email dormant customers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to sending this type of survey is getting your customer to open it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your customer is already dormant, that means <strong>they have a decreased interest in your product <\/strong>and are getting more and more detached from your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of this, it&#8217;s important to advertise your survey in a way that peaks their interest and makes them feel like it&#8217;s worth opening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few example subject lines could be:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Did we do something wrong? We want to know about it. &nbsp;<\/li><li>Can we earn your business back? &nbsp;<\/li><li>Will you tell us how you&#8217;re feeling? &nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/back-dormant-customers.jpg\" alt=\"survey for dormant customers\" class=\"wp-image-19028\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These questions suggest two things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>You&#8217;re aware that you&#8217;ve lost your customer&#8217;s interest and are interested in getting it back. &nbsp;<\/li><li>You&#8217;re ready to listen to what the customer has to say. &nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers like cultivating a relationship with a company. In fact, <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.accessdevelopment.com\/customer-loyalty-statistics-2016-edition\">f<\/a>eeling like you can trust a business is one of the main reasons <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.accessdevelopment.com\/customer-loyalty-statistics-2016-edition\">many customers stay loyal to a product or service<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sending out this survey and assuming the blame for losing this customer is a way to earn back any customers who actually are frustrated or dissatisfied with your product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those customers who simply haven&#8217;t needed to use your services for whatever reason will also be encouraged to open the survey in order to voice their opinions. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">Asking specific questions to understand your dormant customers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the dormant customer opens the survey, you can take advantage of the opportunity to ask honest, important questions about their customer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The questions you must ask <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Why haven&#8217;t you bought from our store recently? &nbsp;<\/li><li>Is there anything we can do to remedy this for you? &nbsp;<\/li><li>Are there competitor&#8217;s products you believe are better quality or more valuable than ours? &nbsp;<\/li><li>Do you have any suggestions for our company to improve our products? &nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/win-dormant-customers.jpg\" alt=\"Questions\" class=\"wp-image-19031\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What can we do to earn your return business? &nbsp;<\/li><li>How can we make our product more convenient to buy?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These questions will give you very helpful insight into what your dormant customers signify. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The main reasons a customer has turned into a dormant one<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have dormant customers because your product is a <a href=\"https:\/\/marketingland.com\/simple-steps-addressing-one-time-buyer-problem-198650\">one-time-buy kind of product<\/a>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or do your dormant customers signify <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.accessdevelopment.com\/customer-loyalty-statistics-2016-edition\">dissatisfied customers who have gone elsewhere<\/a>&nbsp;for their needs?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Figuring out why you have dormant customers is the most useful part of sending out this kind of survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting information on how you can win your customers back is also useful. This is where customer&#8217;s will offer suggestions and let you know what they value in a brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your customers say you can win them back by having better customer service, you have a launch point to make changes in your company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you make the change, you can reach out and let this customer know that you listened to them, took their advice, and acted. If this doesn&#8217;t promote customer loyalty, nothing will.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\">Offering a Promotion to awake dormant customers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the survey, it might be a good idea to include some sort of promotional offer to the dormant customer. Sometimes all dormant customer&#8217;s need is a push or an incentive to purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Offering a simple 25% off the product or a special gift included in a purchase could help you to bring these customers back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coupons are extremely effective ways to win over customers, as almost half of consumers will switch brands happily in order to use a coupon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/dormant-customers.jpg\" alt=\"Dormant customers adv\" class=\"wp-image-19029\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All companies experience dormant customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But knowing how to talk to them, assess the problem, and win back the ones you can is what makes a CMO great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the time to ask your customers what they want and how you can keep them happy, and you will certainly see results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n\n\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n<p><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/20304540\/50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"hs-cta-img-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1.png\" alt=\"15 questions to know your customers needs and expectations\" width=\"700\" height=\"223\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(20304540, '50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1', {\"useNewLoader\":\"true\",\"region\":\"na1\"}); <\/script><\/span><\/p>\n<p><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the best moments as a marketer or salesperson is converting a potential customer into a sale.
