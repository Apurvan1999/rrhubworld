Influencer marketing can address a variety of issues that brands face, especially younger brands:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">How to increase <strong>brand awareness<\/strong>? The goal is to make your values and your story known and to make your audience want to follow your brand. For this purpose, storytelling, or the way you communicate about your brand, plays a key role.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">How to increase sales, and thereby the <strong>conversion rate<\/strong>? Social commerce, which refers to the sale of products and services via social media, is becoming increasingly important on social networks. In parallel, influencers, thanks to links redirecting to your website, are an excellent way to increase your sales, while bringing traffic to your website.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">How to get<strong> better visibility<\/strong> on your products? Influencers are an excellent communication tool. As opinion leaders (KOLS), they promote your products and\/or services to their niche community.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">How to generate <strong>web-to-store traffic<\/strong>? This is a major challenge for brands that have a strong online presence and want to attract customers to their physical stores.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--tertiary-color); font-size: 1.4rem; letter-spacing: -0.2px;\">By <\/span><strong style=\"color: var(--tertiary-color); font-size: 1.4rem; letter-spacing: -0.2px;\">setting clear objectives<\/strong><span style=\"color: var(--tertiary-color); font-size: 1.4rem; letter-spacing: -0.2px;\">, it will be easier for you to <\/span><a style=\"letter-spacing: -0.2px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hivency.com\/en\/your-needs\/find-influencers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">find the right influencers<\/a><span style=\"color: var(--tertiary-color); font-size: 1.4rem; letter-spacing: -0.2px;\"> and build a clear <\/span><a style=\"letter-spacing: -0.2px;\" href=\"\/en\/brand-influencer-collaboration-perfect-brief\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brief<\/a><span style=\"color: var(--tertiary-color); font-size: 1.4rem; letter-spacing: -0.2px;\"> for your future collaborations with influencers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Know your target<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>To optimise a marketing strategy, it is essential to study your target audience.
