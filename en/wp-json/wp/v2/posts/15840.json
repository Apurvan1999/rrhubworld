One of the key strengths of this software is the targeting possibilities that it offers.<\/p>\n<h3>Criteria for customer segmentation<\/h3>\n<p>As we explained in the article <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/criteria-segment-customer-database\">3 important criteria for effective customer segmentation<\/a>,\u00a0<strong>segmentation is the foundation of targeting.<\/strong> The process involves creating audience segments based on criteria such as the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sociodemographic<\/strong>: age, gender, city\/municipality\/region\/country, profession, socio-professional category, family\/conjugal status, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Psychographic<\/strong>: interests, favorite travel destinations, opinions, beliefs, personality traits, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Behavioral<\/strong>: date of most recent purchase, pages visited, average basket size, etc. RFM segmentation is based on behavioral criteria.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Segments are generally based on a combination of multiple criteria (also referred to as \u201cattributes\u201d). For example, the segment \u201cWomen between 30 and 40 years of age\u201d contains two attributes: gender and age.<\/p>\n<h3>Segmentation with Adobe Campaign Standard<\/h3>\n<p>Adobe Campaign offers the possibility for extremely complex targeting, allowing you to create segments with a theoretically infinite number of attributes. For example: \u201cmen between 20 and 30 years old, who live in Toulouse, who like rugby and are registered in a club, etc.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, it is important to note that to create these segments (corresponding to your personas) you\u2019ll need to have the <strong>necessary client data<\/strong>. It is not possible:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>to use an attribute (such as \u201cage\u201d) to help create your personas if you do not have the information you need (in this case, if you do not know the ages of your contacts),<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>or to link a persona to one of your contacts if you do not know the contact\u2019s attributes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p align=\"center\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;height: 470px\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/adobe-campaign-standard-enrich-personas-myfeelback.jpg\" alt=\"adobe-campaign-standard-enrich-personas-myfeelback\" \/><br \/>\n<em>Adobe Campaign <\/em><em>form for creating a segment <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Your personas are a valuable tool that can help you <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/quick-fixes-personalize-your-online-experience\/\">further customize your marketing strategies<\/a>.

Determine the type of information<\/strong>\u00a0that you would like to collect from your contacts. Imagine that you have an online travel agency, and you currently only have three types of information about your contacts in your database: their first names, last names, and email addresses. To improve the targeting of your campaigns in Adobe Campaign, you would like to find out what your contacts\u2019 favorite vacation destinations are: the seaside, the mountains, etc.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 295px;height: 345px\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/adobe-campaign-missing-customer-data.png\" alt=\"dobe-campaign-missing-customer-data\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Create the survey <\/strong>using questions that will provide you with the data that you need. For example: What is your next vacation destination?<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;height: 390px\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/example-myfeelback-surveys.png\" alt=\"example-myfeelback-surveys\" \/><\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Example of a<\/em><em> MyFeelBack<\/em><em> survey aimed at collecting the missing information that will automatically determine which persona is applicable to the contact<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Organize your questions<\/strong>\u00a0by creating a scenario that includes the conditions for displaying each question. For example, if your contact states that they prefer holidays in the Mediterranean, the next question should not ask if the contact prefers hiking or skiing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.\u00a0<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/how-to-integrate-data-adobe-campaign\/\">Set up mapping<\/a>\u00a0to connect your MyFeelBack and Adobe Campaign accounts, to ensure that the data you collect via your surveys can be integrated automatically into Adobe Campaign (and at the correct point on your contact pages).<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 494px;height: 306px\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/mapping-fields-adobe-campaign.png\" alt=\"mapping-fields-adobe-campaign\" \/><br \/>\n<em>Example of mapping that enables you to automatically fill in the form fields for your Adobe contact pages using the data collected via your MyFeelBack survey<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>5.
