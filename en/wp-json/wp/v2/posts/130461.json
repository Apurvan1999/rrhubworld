Why settle for &#8220;good&#8221; results when &#8220;excellent&#8221; results are achievable? To achieve precise objectives through our influencer marketing campaigns, we should strive for excellency. But, how can we make the jump from average to excellent?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the most important steps in this evolution will be <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">choosing the adequate social media<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">network<\/span> for your influencer campaigns. In this article we&#8217;re sharing <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3 influencer marketing tools<\/span> that&#8217;ll help you find the ideal social media for your brand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Influencer marketing tool n\u00ba1: get to know your audience<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: var(--tertiary-color); font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: -0.2px; text-align: justify;\">For a brand, the consumer is always a priority. <a href=\"\/en\/influencer-platform-launch-successful-campaigns\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Influencer marketing campaigns<\/a> are launched for them: it&#8217;s the way we as brands can establish an almost <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">direct communication channel<\/span> between us and our potential clients. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/06\/direct_communication_channel.png\" alt=\"direct_communication_channel\" width=\"767\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 767px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">With this in mind, it&#8217;s obvious we should launch our influencer campaigns on the app where <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">the majority of our consumers<\/span> are. Communicating on a social media where our audience is scarcely present will mean an <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">inefficient influencer campaign<\/span>. It&#8217;s not up to consumers to chase you around, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">you have to go find them wherever they are. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">For this, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">analyze your consumer&#8217;s profiles<\/span> before launching your influencer marketing campaigns. This <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">influencer marketing tool<\/span> will give you the necessary information to understand the habits of your consumers and be able to locate them in the <a href=\"\/en\/infographic-hivency-influencer-pyramid\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">social media environment<\/a>. Here are 3 key points you should absolutely know about your consumers:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Knowing your audience&#8217;s <strong>general characteristics<\/strong> (age, gender&#8230;) is absolutely essential, as it will affect everything, from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hivency.com\/en\/your-needs\/find-influencers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the choice of influencers<\/a>, to the product packaging, through the tone of voice all the way up to <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">the social media for your influencer campaigns.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your clients personal motivations and aspirations. Nowadays, <strong>storytelling is essential on social media<\/strong> to guarantee the success of an enterprise and <strong>the loyalty of consumers<\/strong>. What are their aspirations? What&#8217;s their lifestyle like? This information will help you not only build a discourse around your products\/services, but also find the social media and the influencers that <strong>resemble your audience<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">How do they prefer to <strong>receive information<\/strong>? This will be essential when choosing the social media for your <strong>influencer campaign<\/strong>. Does your client prefer video, photo or written content? Maybe they&#8217;re only really into podcasts. The answer to this question will most likely direct you straight to the social media best adapted to your campaign.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Influencer marketing tool n\u00ba 2: stay up-to-date with the latest social media trends<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You&#8217;ve successfully implemented the first <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">influencer marketing tool<\/span> and have gotten to know your audience: you know everything about them! From here on, watch out, don&#8217;t make the mistake of thinking the work is done! Social media apps are in constant evolution and <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">develop at a frenetic pace<\/span>. For now, you&#8217;ve found the social media that hosts the majority of your audience, but tomorrow that social media could change! That&#8217;s why, to guarantee the maximum success of your influencer marketing campaigns, you have to make the effort of <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">being up to date with the latest novelties of the sector<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here&#8217;s a <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">basic list of elements<\/span> you should keep an eye on:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Know <strong>the new social media apps<\/strong> that are being launched. Even though there&#8217;s a series of <strong>mature<\/strong> <strong>social<\/strong> <strong>media<\/strong> that are well implemented and will <strong>rarely be threatened<\/strong>, new actors appear constantly in the sector, and they could very well <strong>attract the attention of your consumers<\/strong>. Potentially, your current campaigns could become obsolete. Being one of the first to notice and <strong>migrate<\/strong> to new social medias can be a considerable advantage. We can take as an example the cases of <a href=\"\/en\/tiktok-marketing-influence\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok<\/a> and Clubhouse, two social medias that have rapidly become crucial actors of the influencer marketing landscape.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Check regularly the<strong> latest functionalities<\/strong> of your consumer&#8217;s favorite social medias.

We have <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">one more influencer marketing tool to share<\/span>, and you&#8217;ll be ready to launch influencer campaigns that will render <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">excellent<\/span> results.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;\">The best strategy to follow in influencer marketing is <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">to launch numerous campaigns in a variety of networks<\/span> to analyze the efficiency of each. This can be useful to prove that <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">your initial hunch was indeed correct<\/span>, but you may also notice different phenomenons like for instance, a social media that doesn&#8217;t host a lot of your customers may prove<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> much more engaging<\/span>.&nbsp; Influencer campaigns aren&#8217;t limited to one social media, and depending on the objectives of each campaign you&#8217;ll prefer the network with farther reach or the one with a higher engagement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;\">For the brands that want to profit as much as possible from their influencer marketing strategy, the final step would be to request the services of an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hivency.com\/en\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">influencer platform<\/a> such as Hivency.
