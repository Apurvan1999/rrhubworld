The brand uses clean ingredients and has cultivated a cult-like following for products such as their Ultra Repair Cream, which provides long-term hydration for dry skin and even eczema.<\/span><\/p><h3>Challenge<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First Aid Beauty approached Octoly with the main goal of \u201cgetting the products in the hands of influencers and getting them familiar with them,\u201d says Hannah Ameen, Social Media and PR Coordinator for the brand. \u201cOur number one goal will always be building awareness, but our second goal is content creation. How can we leverage these great creators to create beautiful content that we can repurpose across multiple channels?\u201d <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recognizing that TikTok is a place to reach Gen-Z consumers with fresh and engaging content, Octoly was First Aid\u2019s TikTok content launch partner.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the brand had only a small influencer team with limited time for outreach.<\/span><\/p><h3>The Solution<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the past six months, First Aid Beauty has ramped up its social media content with the help of Octoly, says Nicole Saylor, the brand\u2019s Manager of Influencer Marketing. Previously doing 25 campaigns a year, they\u2019re currently working at 100-250 campaigns per year.&nbsp; \u201cContent has been a huge push for us and having Octoly in those moments has been an incredible tool,\u201d she says. First Aid Beauty often uses Octoly to connect with micro and macro-influencers alongside their larger campaign marketing.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First Aid Beauty focused on utilizing Octoly to connect the brand with high-quality influencers with the goal of reusing the content as organic social, something they say will be used across the paid and e-commerce team down the line also. Octoly has provided the opportunity to gather user-generated content away from a professional studio. With a small team, First Aid Beauty had previously shipped influencer packages in-house and now trusts Octoly to handle the shipments in order to reach a larger audience and meet their goal of increasing awareness.<\/span><\/p><h3>Results<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span>First Aid Beauty\u2019s TikTok campaign led to increased awareness of the brand\u2019s core products and new, first-class launches. By leveraging Octoly&#8217;s influencer community of beauty content creators &amp; skincare junkies, First Aid Beauty saw a noticeable uplift in follower count on their brand\u2019s social handle on TikTok.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First Aid Beauty\u2019s campaign push, with the help of Octoly, has the brand trending upwards and into other markets worldwide. Saylor says this is something they couldn\u2019t have done without Octoly. \u201cWe feel like this is a huge lever that we can pull at any time and we can trust,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels like part of the fabric of First Aid Beauty in general and the content creation has been incredible.\u201d&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The brand has used Octoly to build new relationships with influencers, and create beautiful content but also feel like they\u2019re just at the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d with what they plan to do with Octoly. \u201cOur larger team has seen the power of this tool and, with more capacity with shipping, we\u2019re excited to explore more untapped power of Octoly that we haven\u2019t got a chance to play with yet,\u201d says Saylor.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">The results in 1 year<\/p><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Influencer&nbsp; Posts<\/h4><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>1,493<\/span><\/p><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">REACH<\/h4><p style=\"text-align: center;\">10M<\/p><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Interactions<\/h4><p style=\"text-align: center;\">517K<\/p><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">ENGAGEMENT<\/h4><p style=\"text-align: center;\">3.86%<\/p><p><strong>&#8220;Octoly feels like part of our bread and butter now.
