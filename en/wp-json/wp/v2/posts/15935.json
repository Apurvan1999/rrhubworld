Experiences count for more. And this is why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/marketing\/insights\/customer-experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">89% of marketers are putting customer experience at the center<\/a> of their branding, design, and delivery decisions. Without question, customer experience has become the single most important way for marketers to differentiate their products and services.<\/p>\n<p>So what steps are marketers taking to create a better customer experience? Take a look at these three strategies, all of which have been proven to increase satisfaction, reduce churn, and increase revenue.<\/p>\n<h2>1) Personalization<\/h2>\n<h3>The problem<\/h3>\n<p>A 2016 Econsultancy survey reports that while two in three marketers say &#8216;personalizing customer interactions&#8217; is &#8216;very important&#8217;, less than one in ten say that they are actually able to create personalized content <a href=\"https:\/\/econsultancy.com\/reports\/email-census\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">beyond using the customer&#8217;s name.<\/a> Of course, today\u2019s customer expects a business to be capable of doing a little more than just remembering their name. Customers want to see that you understand their needs and wants, that you are able to provide them with a relevant experience across all channels, that you understand what they need most and when they need it most.<\/p>\n<h3>The solution<\/h3>\n<p>Get to know your customers beyond their name. If you ask them, they are probably more than happy to share their needs, wants, and attitudes about your products and services. Studies show that 83% of consumers have already completed at least one or, in many cases, three to four feedback surveys in the past 12 months. <strong>70% of this feedback is collected via online surveys which customers identify as helping \u201ccompanies improve the products they build and carry.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>The benefits<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Makes your marketing more relevant<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Improves customer retention<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Increases conversions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>2) Customer Advocates<\/h2>\n<h3>The problem<\/h3>\n<p>The ability to harness and leverage positive word-of-mouth has become one of the most important skills a marketer can take. Word-of-mouth is now a primary factor behind most purchasing decisions with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/local-consumer-review-survey-2014\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">88% of people trusting online reviews<\/a> written by other consumers as much as they trust recommendations from personal contacts. Moreover, 4 out of 10 consumers regularly turn to customer reviews before making any purchase. This means that you need customer advocates who are willing to say good things about you. Without them, you may be missing out on an especially powerful way to promote your business.<\/p>\n<h3>The solution<\/h3>\n<p>Customer feedback. You won\u2019t know who your advocates are unless you engage your customers. Learn as much as you can about them and whose needs, goals, and challenges you are most effectively addressing. Look at who is most satisfied with your product or service offerings. Your advocates will be the ones who give you highest <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/csat-nps-ces-right-metric-for-superior-cx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CES, NPS, or CSAT<\/a> scores.<\/p>\n<h3>The benefits<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Referrals through positive word-of-mouth<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>User-generated content like online reviews and testimonials<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduced marketing costs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>3) Omni-channel<\/h2>\n<h3>The problem<\/h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobilepaymentstoday.com\/blogs\/omnichannel-banking-a-consumer-first-not-bank-first-experience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">98% of Americans regularly interact with a business across a variety of channels<\/a><\/strong> \u2013 in-store, online, on social, and on mobile.\u00a0 But the key to a successful omnichannel strategy isn\u2019t just the number of channels made available to customers; it is also ensuring that all of those channels work together in an effortless and intuitive way. One of the easiest ways to frustrate your customers is not allowing them to pick up where they left off when they switched from one channel to another. If your channels are not integrated and consistent, you are giving your customers every reason to look for a better option.<\/p>\n<h3>The solution<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t miss out an opportunity to exceed your customers\u2019 expectations. Context-driven clearly focused surveys to measure customer happiness are the easiest way to capture customer feedback at every touchpoint across the customer journey: browsing, checkout, customer support.\u00a0 Feedback surveys will tell you where customers are experiencing friction and what you need to do to improve specific problems with your omnichannel experience.<\/p>\n<h3>The benefits<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement quick fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Capture knowledge over time for ongoing assessment<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Solidify customer loyalty<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Today\u2019s Customer Experience Battleground<\/h2>\n<p>Create an experience that keeps customers coming back for more. The fact is, there really is no other way to create a clear point of differentiation, no better way to establish a clear competitive advantage. If you don\u2019t grasp whom your customers are and design an experience which speaks to them, your business will suffer while those who are able to build a strong experience will thrive in today\u2019s increasingly competitive marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>To be successful, you must have access to knowledge that provides a clear picture of who your customers are and how you can best serve them. Gathering comprehensive customer feedback requires an investment in time and resource but it is a necessary investment if you want your customer experience to stand out from the crowd.<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--> <a href=\"http:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d-1.png\" alt=\"Download Ebook How to Learn from your Customers and Get Ahead of your Competitors\" \/><\/a> <\/span> <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n\n        hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d', {});\n    \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span> <!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Choice, simplicity, trust, and personalized experiences \u2013 these are the things today\u2019s customers desire most.
