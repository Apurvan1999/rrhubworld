If used correctly and effectively, a single YouTube video can give brands massive exposure in the form of thousands of engaged eyes. Hiring a YouTuber for a sponsored video requires looking beyond subscriber amounts and view counts. Here is a checklist of key metrics and things to consider when calculating how much to pay YouTubers as a brand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Engagement and audience sentiment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>When scouting for YouTubers, examine the sentiment surrounding the engagement they receive. YouTube is unique in that users can both \u201clike\u201d and \u201cdislike\u201d videos. Pay close attention to the like-to-dislike ratios, comments-to-views ratios, as well as what kinds of comments viewers are leaving. If their audience\u2019s sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and is coupled with a high amount of engagement, a YouTuber can justify a higher quote. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Watch time<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Watch time refers to the number of minutes users spend watching a YouTuber\u2019s content. Views, on the other hand, are garnered when a video is watched for at least 30 seconds. Once a viewer makes it past the 30-second mark, YouTube will count that as a view, even if the viewer stops watching right then and there. Watch time is a stronger indicator of how tuned in a YouTuber\u2019s audience really is. The more minutes they\u2019ve racked up, the more value they\u2019ll bring to any sponsored campaign. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Retention<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2019\/apr\/16\/got-a-minute-global-attention-span-is-narrowing-study-reveals\">average person\u2019s attention span is only 8 seconds<\/a> and it\u2019s only getting shorter. The longer a YouTuber can hold someone\u2019s attention, the more value they bring to brands. YouTube Analytics shows two types of retention: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Absolute Audience Retention: <\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">This pinpoints the most-watched parts of a given video. You can identify patterns in how the audience views a video, for example: do they skip over the intro? Do they drop off at the end? For a sponsored video, it\u2019s important to make sure that the product\/service is mentioned during one of the most-engaged-with time frames of the video.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span>Relative Audience Retention: <\/span><\/strong><span>Compares videos of similar length to see whether or not the YouTuber\u2019s videos have above, below, or average retention.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span>High retention rates are not easy to cultivate and, much like watch time, indicate that a YouTuber\u2019s videos are super engaging to their audience. The higher the retention rates, the higher the price for a sponsored video. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dedicated vs. Non-Dedicated<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Non-dedicated videos are significantly less expensive than dedicated ones, no matter the YouTuber. In a non-dedicated video, YouTubers mention a product\/service without making it the sole focus of the video. Brands like HelloFresh and SeatGeek have partnered with some of the biggest creators on YouTube on non-dedicated campaigns. In a dedicated video, the YouTuber produces an entire video about the sponsored brand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Timeline<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Video production and editing can take a substantial amount of time, so be sure to keep this in mind when hiring a YouTuber. For a turnaround time of one week or less, a YouTuber may charge brands a rush fee, adding to the total cost of the sponsored video. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Request a Demo<\/h2>\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_6  et_pb_text_align_justified et_pb_bg_layout_light\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>Octoly makes it easy for brands to build authentic text reviews and amazing influencer content with product seeding campaigns at scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Related Articles<\/h2>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the second-most visited site on the web boasting 1 billion hours worth of content watched per day, YouTube is a video behemoth.
