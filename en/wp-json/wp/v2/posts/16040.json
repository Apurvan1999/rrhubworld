In fact, <strong>only a quarter of businesses claim to have in place a fully integrated system<\/strong>. For everyone else, the lack of system integration often cripples any efforts to obtain a 360-degree view and, therefore, stifles the potential benefits this information could bring.<\/p>\n<h2>Three ways a lack of data in your CRM is hurting your business<\/h2>\n<p>The less organized and focused your CRM is, the more your business will suffer.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how:<\/p>\n<h3>1) Poor customer service because of a non-integrated CRM<\/h3>\n<p>When customer information is stored in myriad, disconnected silos, there is often no clear path to resolving complex issues. Forrester reports that this is, in fact, a problem for 42% of surveyed service agents, all of whom admit they are unable to efficiently resolve customer issues <strong>due to lack of easily accessible and complete customer information<\/strong>. At the same time, 45% of customers cite lack of prompt support as the primary reason for why they will abandon a transaction.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 434px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-service-with-crm.jpg\" alt=\"customer-service-with-crm\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2) A lack of data in your CRM wastes Marketing Efforts<\/h3>\n<p>Many marketers have limited information about their customers, so they typically rely on generic marketing efforts <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.adobe.com\/digitaleurope\/digital-marketing\/adobe-digital-roadblock-report-2015\/\">rather than addressing the unique needs of their customers<\/a> which, according to Adobe study, is the single most important ingredient for marketing success. Customers want \u2013 and expect \u2013 a personalized marketing experience, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.janrain.com\/about\/newsroom\/press-releases\/online-consumers-fed-up-with-irrelevant-content-on-favorite-websites-according-to-janrain-study\/\"><strong>74% expressing frustration<\/strong><\/a><strong> with businesses which deliver irrelevant marketing content<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 569px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/importance-crm-marketing.jpg\" alt=\"importance-crm-marketing\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3) Inability to Personalize through your CRM platform<\/h3>\n<p>Digital Trends reports that <strong>73% of consumers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/social-media\/why-consumers-are-increasingly-willing-to-trade-data-for-personalization\/#ixzz2g8dgrqko\">prefer to do business with brands that use personal information<\/a> to make their shopping experiences more relevant<\/strong>. Businesses which can access a complete history of a customer\u2019s buying habits are at an advantage, able to make product recommendations, a service likely to foster brand loyalty. And business which<strong> personalize across all channels<\/strong> \u2013 in-store, online, mobile \u2013 experience the most benefit. These businesses have mastered the ability to connect data from all channels, creating a seamless customer experience which, according to one study,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.monetate.com\/blog\/the-tipping-point-for-personalized-website-experiences\/\"> increases sales by up to 40%<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 434px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/personalize-relationship-with-crm.jpg\" alt=\"personalize-relationship-with-crm\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In other words, data which provides <strong>a 360-degree view<\/strong> of your customers reduces <strong>customer churn and attrition<\/strong> costs while increases customer loyalty and marketing effectiveness. Being able to zero in on what a particular customer needs, at any given moment, is crucial to your business\u2019s success. The more connected you are to who your customers are and why they come to you,<strong> the easier<\/strong> it will be for you to <strong>meaningfully engage them, <\/strong>develop<strong> trusted relationships, solve problems<\/strong> and, quite likely,<strong> up-sell and cross-sell the right products<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>Improving the quality of your data in your CRM<\/h2>\n<p>Remember: developing a strong CRM will not happen overnight. A truly integrated 360-degree view of the customer extends not just across channels and internal departments but across time. A true 360-degree picture must include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data about<strong> customer profiles<\/strong>. This allows segments to be built according to Socio-demographic, Psychological and Behavioural criteria.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>\u200bDiscover<a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/criteria-customer-segmentation-database\/\"> 3 criteria to know to correctly segment your customer database<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Past and present purchases<\/strong>.\u00a0This may seem obvious, but it is sometimes difficult to cross-reference the different purchases of the same customer if they are made on various channels. The issue may be due to a lack of integration of information systems, or a lack of traceability, particularly when purchasing in stores.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Past and present <strong>interactions with the <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/keys-offer-best-customer-service\/\">Customer service<\/a><\/strong>.\u00a0This is an essential part of the life cycle of your relationship with the customer. Customer service, must be able to have this global vision of all interactions with your company at a glance. To do this, this timeline must be <strong>integrated into the same tool.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Future <strong>influences<\/strong> that can be used to prevent churn, maximize upsell and cross-sell, and, of course, maintain loyalty.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the end, a 360 view will provide the knowledge your company needs to improve customer satisfaction and business success. Your ability to update, maintain, and integrate data across all departments and channels can \u2013 and no doubt will \u2013 play a big part in your CRM\u2019s usefulness. Myfeelback is a very efficient tool for collecting declarative data on customers via intelligent surveys.
