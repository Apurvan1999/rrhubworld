For example, on an e-commerce site, this refers to the number of visitors that make a purchase.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Discover <a href=\"http:\/\/get.myfeelback.com\/ode-a-la-rose-en\">How Ode \u00e0 la rose increases sales by 3% by questioning abandoning visitors<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to keep in mind that developing your website traffic is only one of two key areas of focus, and is not an objective in and of itself. Having 50 000 unique visitors to your website is a great start, but you\u2019ll also need to focus on converting this traffic in order for it to benefit your business and lead to an increase in revenue.<\/p>\n<p>This is what we\u2019ll be focusing on in this article about <strong>monetizing your website.<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><strong><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"monetization-website\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/monetization-website.jpg\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 488px;\"><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Monetizing a website refers to the strategies and methods used to earn revenue through website traffic. In the past, advertising has been the primary method of earning revenue via a website, but of course, it is not the only strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>Monetization through advertising<\/h3>\n<p>When you think about monetizing a website, advertising is most likely the first thing that comes to mind. This is usually done through an ad network, which connects:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Publishers \u2014 <\/strong>people who are looking to display ads on their sites with:<\/li>\n<li><strong>Advertisers \u2014 <\/strong>companies looking to promote their products or services via website advertising.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are a variety of different ad networks on the market. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/intl\/en_en\/adsense\/start\/#\/?modal_active=none\">AdSense<\/a>, Google\u2019s ad network, is by far the most well-known. Its ease of use is the reason for its success \u2014 simply indicate the places on your website where you\u2019d like to display <strong>ad banners, <\/strong>and Google displays these ads automatically, based on the content published on your site.<\/p>\n<p>Revenue is earned via a <strong>cost-per-click <\/strong>model: the publisher earns money every time a visitor clicks on the ad. The amount can vary between .50\u20ac and 5\u20ac, depending on the ads that are displayed, as well as their format, placement, and quantity.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"monetization-website-ads\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/monetization-website-ads.jpg\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 346px;\"><\/p>\n<p>But AdSense is far from being the only player on the market. There are dozens, even hundreds of ad networks, including DoubleClick AdExchange (the premium version of&nbsp; Google AdSense, which is more complex to use), Sizmek and Criteo (specialized in retargeting), Attentive Ads, AdFever, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past decade, the percentage of revenue earned from website advertising has diminished. There are three main reasons for this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Website visitors are tired of seeing ads on websites. This is known as \u201cad fatigue\u201d. When they\u2019ve seen too many ads, visitors become less receptive, eventually ignoring the ads completely.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"ad-fatigue\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/ad-fatigue.jpg\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 468px;\"><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A<strong> lower cost-per-click<\/strong> for advertisers. The CPC has a tendency to decrease every year, a trend that stems from the above point.<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>A larger number of <strong>website monetization options <\/strong>available.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We would like to emphasize this last point: nowadays, there are various different ways to monetize a website other than advertising. To give a brief overview, here is a (non-exhaustive) list:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Selling products or services, <\/strong>such as products on an e-commerce site, training, consulting\/coaching services, etc.<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Collecting leads<\/strong> using forms and selling them via platforms like Eolad or AffiniLead.<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Creating&nbsp;<strong>paid content<\/strong>, such as ebooks, white papers, guides, etc.<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sponsored articles.<\/strong><br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Affiliate marketing<\/strong>, a growing monetization strategy. Website publishers provide their audience with opportunities to purchase products or services offered by other companies, and receive a commission if these are purchased. Like with ads, there are various different platforms that connect advertisers and publishers, including Affilinet, TimeOne, Trade Doubler, CJ Commission Jonction, Zanox, etc.<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"example-affiliate-marketing\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/example-affiliate-marketing.jpg\" style=\"width: 649px; height: 331px;\"><\/p>\n<p>There are many different approaches to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/startbloggingonline.com\/how-to-monetize-website\/\">monetizing your website traffic.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll now show you how gaining a more detailed knowledge of your website\u2019s visitors, via surveys, can help you monetize your website more effectively, regardless of the approach you are using.<\/p>\n<h2>How to use customer knowledge to monetize your website more effectively?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Surveys<\/strong> can help you better understand your visitors \u2014 who they are, as well as their needs and goals. Here\u2019s how more detailed customer knowledge can help you <strong>monetize your website more effectively,<\/strong> regardless of the strategy you are using.<\/p>\n<p>As you most likely don\u2019t have the email addresses of your website\u2019s visitors (they are not logged in to your website), these surveys will mainly be deployed on the website itself (using pop in, chatbots, etc.) or on social networks.<\/p>\n<h3>How surveys can help you optimize your ad campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>The effectiveness of an ad campaign is directly related to having well-targeted ads, meaning ads that are relevant to your site\u2019s audience. Using surveys to ask your visitors about their buying preferences, tastes, interests, budget, etc. will help you select the advertisers\/ad network that are most in line with your audience.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"survey-visitor-knowledge-example\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/survey-visitor-knowledge-example.jpg\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 340px;\"><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The goal is to <strong>increase the conversion rate <\/strong>for the ads displayed on the site \u2014more specifically, to increase the click-through rate.<\/p>\n<h3>\nBoost your lead capture and affiliate marketing strategies through surveys<\/h3>\n<p>Visitor surveys deployed on your site can also help you improve:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your <strong>lead capture <\/strong>strategy. By knowing <strong>what your visitors are looking for, <\/strong>you\u2019ll be able to offer them forms (to request a quote, make an appointment, etc.) that correspond to the services they are interested in. You can also create surveys that include contact form elements, helping you determine the needs of visitors who are looking to get in touch with your company, request a quote or estimate, etc.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"example-question-ameliorate-ctr\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/example-questions-ameliorate-ctr.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 375px;\"><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sales of paid content.<\/strong> By learning more about your website visitors, you can offer paid content that corresponds to their areas of interest.<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Your <strong>affiliate marketing <\/strong>strategy. Knowing more about your visitors\u2019 needs and expectations can help you choose which products to feature on your page and recommend to your audience. One of the keys to a successful affiliate marketing strategy is presenting products that are truly likely to interest your visitors.<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In general, inviting your visitors to answer a couple of questions while they browse your site can help you identify any points of friction that could be holding back conversions on your website and reducing monetization.<\/p>\n<p>These questions could be related to the usability of the site, as well as its layout, loading speed, offerings, etc. Of course, the questions that you select will depend on your business, your industry, your target audience, etc.<\/p>\n<h3>How Larousse Cuisine used surveys to improve their conversion rate<\/h3>\n<p>One of MyFeelBack\u2019s clients, Larousse Cuisine, uses surveys to determine the needs of their website\u2019s visitors and recommend products accordingly. These surveys are deployed via MyFeelBack\u2019s ChatSurvey, and data from these can be used to encourage visitors to advance more quickly through the sales funnel.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"example-larousse-know-visitor-better\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/example-larousse-know-visitor-better.png\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 356px;\"><\/p>\n<p>Tip: Why not show a pop-in to visitors who are about to leave your site without converting? This is known as an<strong> exit-intent pop in<\/strong>, and can help you understand why the visitor did not take the desired action, such as purchasing a product, signing up for a trial period, filling in a form, etc.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><b>Discover <a href=\"http:\/\/get.myfeelback.com\/hachette-en\">How Hachette collects data on its editors through a powerful CRM enrichment<\/a>.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Improving the user experience and the content of your website are two of the best ways to optimize your monetization strategy.<\/p>\n<p>If some of your website\u2019s visitors have subscribed to your <strong>newsletter,<\/strong> you can send them a targeted survey to learn more about their needs and preferences. In this specific case, the survey can be deployed by email. By gaining a better understanding of your newsletter\u2019s subscribers, you can better target your offerings.<\/p>\n<h3>\nImprove customer knowledge to optimize monetization strategies<\/h3>\n<p>It is clear that each of these different approaches to website monetization (displaying ads, selling products or content, affiliate marketing, etc.) can be optimized through a <strong>better understanding of your site\u2019s visitors. <\/strong>This is because the performance of your website is essentially based on your ability to provide your site\u2019s visitors with the offerings, products, services and content that meets their needs and expectations. Surveys can help you better understand the individuals behind your website traffic statistics, and improve your offerings and your content accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-14ab023c-16dc-4da7-bf0d-96e7ec24499a\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-14ab023c-16dc-4da7-bf0d-96e7ec24499a\" id=\"hs-cta-14ab023c-16dc-4da7-bf0d-96e7ec24499a\"><!--[if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/14ab023c-16dc-4da7-bf0d-96e7ec24499a\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-14ab023c-16dc-4da7-bf0d-96e7ec24499a\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/14ab023c-16dc-4da7-bf0d-96e7ec24499a-1.png\" style=\"border-width:0px;\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n hbspt.cta.load(744484, '14ab023c-16dc-4da7-bf0d-96e7ec24499a', {}); \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --> &nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you looking for ways to monetize your site more effectively?
