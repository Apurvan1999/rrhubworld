The company measures satisfaction levels at both the national and franchise level across multiple channels: Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and customer satisfaction surveys. They then synchronize the data, creating a clear picture of the customer journey. With this information, McDonald\u2019s is <strong>better positioned to identify critical points of interaction and, in real time, address problems which cause customer friction<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to increase overall transparency, the company encourages discussion on social media, enabling customers to make menu suggestions or ask any questions they have about the quality of the food, a long standing point of criticism for the brand. For example, customer feedback is directly responsible for the company\u2019s recent announcement that it plans to discontinue using caged chickens to produce eggs. In addition, it will serve breakfast throughout the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a company press release,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cmore than 120,000 people tweeted McDonald\u2019s asking for breakfast throughout the day in the past year alone.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">Modern Day Customer Service<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some financial experts <a href=\"https:\/\/customerthink.com\/why-mcdonalds-customer-service-sucks-in-three-charts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blame McDonald\u2019s dwindling sales<\/a> on the fact that the company has failed to acknowledge the changing tastes and ideals of customers, unlike competitors In-N-Out Burger and Chipotle, both of which receive consistently high marks for customer service while also managing to provide inexpensive and quick food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, the McDonald\u2019s model was created for a different kind of customer in a bygone era, a customer who accepted that McDonald\u2019s prepared its food ahead of time, so that when the customer arrived, it was ready to eat. But today\u2019s consumer has evolved, rejecting the cookie-cutter delivery model of the past in favor of innovation and indivualisation.
