One, short, <strong>easy to measure<\/strong> question makes this survey simple and easy for the customers to fill out, but also for the marketing team that needs to analyze it.<\/p>\n<p>Customers love it because it&#8217;s short and to the point, yet it gives them<strong> room to provide more <\/strong>detailed feedback if they want to.<\/p>\n<p>Companies love it because it is easy to measure and <strong>can be benchmarked<\/strong>, meaning you can compare your score with competitors, and compare it with previous years.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/simple-nps.jpg\" alt=\"simple-nps\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">2- <\/span>Net Promoter Score gets clear feedback<\/h3>\n<p>Because it\u2019s so simple, Net Promoter Score surveys tend to <strong>get a lot more feedback<\/strong> than other surveys.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Did you know that <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/recover-failing-business-with-nps-survey\/\">80% of customers will abandon a survey<\/a> because of drawn out, useless questions?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The NPS survey avoids losing those users that get bored and allows you to <strong>capitalize on responses<\/strong> from those who usually abandon a survey, when it gets too long and tedious. Sending out a survey that your customers will actually answer to, is <strong>the key to gaining useful customer knowledge<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">3-<\/span>\u00a0Net Promoter Score is effective<\/h3>\n<p>The main reason why the NPS is <strong>so popular <\/strong>is simply because it\u2019s effective, and the reason it\u2019s so effective is in its wording. The NPS metric doesn\u2019t just ask if a customer likes a product, they ask whether or not they would <strong>stake their reputation in order to recommend it<\/strong> to someone they care about. This wording shifts the gears and heeds a more honest, informative response from customers.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.measuringu.com\/blog\/nps-ux.php\">One study shows<\/a> that no matter your industry, the NPS survey question is \u201cthe best or second best predictor of repeat purchases or referrals.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Because it\u2019s such an effective <strong>predictor of customer loyalty<\/strong>, it\u2019s seen as the frontrunner for companies trying to feel out how their customers view their company as a whole.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">4-<\/span>\u00a0Net Promoter Score introduces you to brand ambassadors<\/h3>\n<p>The NPS score doesn\u2019t just give insight to your customer loyalty, it can also help your marketing team discover new brand ambassadors for your company.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/ambassador-customer.jpg\" alt=\"ambassadors-nps\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Getting your customers to be brand ambassadors is marketing gold, although it can sometimes be hard to track this potential down. But when a customer gives you a score of 9 or 10 on the NPS survey, it\u2019s fair to assume these are advocates for your product.<\/p>\n<p>By nurturing your promoters, you can insure that they will talk about you and promote your company, because of how strongly they believe and feel about it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><b>Read more: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/truth-about-nps-promoters-detractors-passives\/\">The Truth About Your NPS Promoters, Detractors and Passives.<\/a><\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>The Net Promoter Score CONS<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ll be honest, we don\u2019t have a lot of cons to offer regarding the NPS survey.
