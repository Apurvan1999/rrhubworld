Not necessarily. Increasingly, studies are showing that investing in smaller influencers, either nano influencers (with 1,000 to 5,000 followers) or micro-influencers (under 10,000 followers), at scale will give you more bang for your buck.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no denying that the state of influencer marketing has shifted during the past few years. While more traditional influencers <a href=\"https:\/\/w3-lab.com\/instagram-reach-is-down-is-instagram-dying-2021\/\">are experiencing a reduced reach<\/a>, smaller influencers are seeing an increase in popularity. Staying within the sweet spot between 1,000 to 10,000 followers seems to be the key and, luckily, there are countless nano and micro-influencers to choose from. <a href=\"https:\/\/mention.com\/en\/reports\/instagram\/followers\/\">According to a report by Mention<\/a>, 15.7% of Instagram users have between 1,000 and 10,000 followers.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s why nano and micro-influencers reign supreme in the new post-pandemic influencer landscape of 2021.<\/p><p>Authenticity<\/p><p>Since nano and micro-influencers have a smaller audience, they also have a closer relationship with their followers, being viewed as a peer rather than an unattainable ideal. Since studies show that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingdive.com\/news\/micro-influencers-have-major-impact-on-buying-behavior-study\/416579\/\">70% of millennial consumers<\/a> are influenced by the recommendations of their peers in buying decisions, this can easily translate to sales. Not only do small influencers have 22.2 times more conversations weekly about purchasing recommendations compared to an average consumer, but their audience is more likely to believe them when they promote a product that they actually love. Chances are, you may even be their first sponsored or gifted post.<\/p><p>Higher engagement<\/p><p>According to the recent <a href=\"https:\/\/hypeauditor.com\/blog\/state-2020\/#Engagement_Rate_by_Category\">State of Influencer Marketing<\/a> by HypeAuditor, the engagement rate of nano-influencers is twice as high as that of other groups of influencers. This is because Instagram has recently been crowded with sponsored posts, resulting in influencer engagement rates reaching near all-time lows. In 2019, the engagement rate for Instagram influencers with at least 10,000 followers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingdive.com\/news\/instagram-influencer-engagement-hovers-near-all-time-lows-study-says\/558331\/\">was steady at about 3.6% worldwide<\/a>. Those with 1,000 to 5,000, however, had the highest rate at 8.8%, per Influencer. Essentially, engagement gets better with the fewer followers you have, meaning a nano influencer might produce the same amount of likes, saves, and clicks than one with a higher follower count.<\/p><p>Brand Enthusiasm <\/p><p>At the end of the day, nano and micro influencers are everyday people who are balancing their everyday lives with social media, rather than seasoned influencers. This usually makes them eager and excited to try your product and share it with their friends. They\u2019re also the master of UGC, creating relatable and authentic content that your brand can reshare.<\/p><p>Cost-effective <\/p><p>Here\u2019s where using a nano and micro influencer strategy at scale comes in. Because these influencers are often happy to post a product in exchange for gifting, rather than expecting payment, it becomes easy to utilize a variety of influencers and maximize reach. At Octoly, we can connect you with a diverse range of influencers through our gifting marketplace so that your brand or product can cover a wider area on social media, making nano and micro influencers a small but mighty part of your overall marketing strategy.<\/p><p>Building Future Brand Ambassadors<\/p><p>Gifting nano and micro influencers at scale allows brands to develop and nurture influencer relationships that can lead to long term collaborations. This investment from both marketer and influencer is what leads to genuine brand advocates. After all, you took the time to build your brand to what it is today. It deserves the time and care from an influencer who feels as excited about it as you are.<\/p><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Request a Demo<\/h2><div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_6  et_pb_text_align_justified et_pb_bg_layout_light\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto; font-weight: normal; font-size: x-large;\">Octoly makes it easy for brands to build authentic text reviews and amazing influencer content with product seeding campaigns at scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><h2>Related Articles<\/h2>\n\n\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":124605,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"post_folder":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.6 -
