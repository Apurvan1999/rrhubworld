Once your mapping rules are configured, your <strong>CRM<\/strong> will be <strong>enriched in real time <\/strong>thanks to Skeepers.<\/p>\n<p>Do not hesitate to <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/demo-en\/\">contact us<\/a><\/strong> if you have any questions about the integration, Skeepers team will support you to make sure the integration process goes smoothly.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll now discover the 2 main benefits of the Skeepers and Salesforce integration.<\/p>\n<h2>1- Enrich your Salesforce CRM data<\/h2>\n<p>The primary vocation of Skeepers, is to help you with your <strong>customer knowledge<\/strong> process, to help you better know your customers, who they are, what they like or what they expect from you.<\/p>\n<p>To achieve this goal, our solution allows you to create <strong>ultra-targeted surveys<\/strong> and <strong>collect cross-channel answers<\/strong>. The surveys can indeed be distributed on all your channels (website, email, social networks, sms, mobile application&#8230;) and at all stages of the<strong>\u00a0customer&#8217;s journey<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Considering this, we decided to develop the Salesforce connector. With it, you can\u00a0retrieve collected data to your Salesforce platform\u00a0<strong>automatically and<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>in real time<\/strong>, through surveys such as: customer dissatisfaction, product preferences, purchasing habits, needs, interests, expectations, profile data, etc.<\/p>\n<p>The answers collected from your surveys are <strong>synchronized<\/strong> in the Salesforce customer fields. Any custom records and properties are thus <strong>enriched and continuously updated.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/integration-connector.png\" alt=\"integration\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Data from Skeepers surveys can feed Salesforce Marketing Cloud, to give you a 360\u00b0 view of your customer or create &#8220;cases&#8221; to improve the productivity of your salesforce support team.<\/p>\n<p>With this integration, you can also receive Skeepers <strong>notifications<\/strong> on the Salesforce Chatter for each response collected.<\/p>\n<p>The power of a <strong>CRM<\/strong>\u00a0heavily depends on the <strong>quality and quantity<\/strong> of the customer data it contains. The Skeepers \/ Salesforce integration <strong>reinforces the power<\/strong> of your customer relationship management tool by offering you a <strong>360\u00b0 view<\/strong> of each of your customers.<\/p>\n<p>The Salesforce connector responds to one of the major problems often encountered by companies: <strong>data dispersion<\/strong>, linked to the multiplicity of tools used. By connecting MyFeelBack and Salesforce, all your customer data is <strong>collected and reconciled<\/strong> in your CRM.<\/p>\n<p>Your teams can manage their campaigns from a single interface: Salesforce CRM. The integration of Skeepers and Salesforce ensures a <strong>unified and simplified customer relationship<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Discover <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/customer-experience-technologies\/\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">4 resolutions fro CRM managers in 2018.<\/span><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>2- Trigger personalized marketing actions on your Salesforce contacts<\/h2>\n<p>Customer knowledge serves customer relationship performance and marketing performance.
