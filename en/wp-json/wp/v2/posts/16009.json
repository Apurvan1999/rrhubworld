A CRM without data is like a car without petrol.<\/p>\n<p>MyFeelBack\u2019s customer knowledge solution has the answer. Thanks to our MyFeelBack &lt;&gt; Splio connector, you can enrich your Splio CRM data in real time with your customer survey answers.<\/p>\n<p>Read on to discover 3 advantages of this integration.<\/p>\n<h2>1 &#8211; Enriching your Splio CRM data<\/h2>\n<p>Splio is an all-in-one solution, both a CRM tool and a Marketing Automation solution. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.splio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Splio<\/a> enables you to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Centralise the management of your cross-channel customer interactions.<\/li>\n<li>Deploy your campaigns and marketing scenarios.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To get the most out of your CRM, you need to feed it with <strong>customer data<\/strong>. This data will enable you to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Personalise your customer interactions.<\/strong> For example, the more your Customer Service agents have access to customer files with lots of information, the more they can adapt their immediate response to the customer\u2019s needs and expectations.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Create ultra-targeted campaigns and marketing scenarios.<\/strong> Remember that any campaign or scenario needs data before it can be implemented. Even for a \u201cbasic\u201d scenario, such as the \u201cbirthday\u201d scenario, you need to know your customers\u2019 date of birth. Data helps to better target your scenarios, and first and foremost to create them!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The first reason to integrate MyFeelBack and Splio is therefore to <strong>increase your Customer Knowledge<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 295px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/integration-splio-en.jpg\" alt=\"Enrich Splio with customer data\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Thanks to the connector we have developed, you can synchronise the answers obtained via your surveys in your contact files. Simply create <strong>matching rules <\/strong>to associate fields in your surveys with fields in your customer files.<\/p>\n<p>You can ask your customers all kinds of questions with MyFeelBack, allowing you to enrich your CRM with whatever data you want (according to your Splio use cases and objectives):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sociodemographic &amp; identity data: age, sex, address, date of birth, marital status, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Psychographic data: interests, buying preference, channel preference, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Behavioural data: buying habits, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>2 &#8211; Integrating customer satisfaction indicators (NPS, CSAT, CES\u2026)<\/h2>\n<p>To improve the customer experience, you need to know who your customers are, what they like and what they do. But sociodemographic, psychographic, and behavioural data is not enough. It is important to know whether or not your customers are satisfied. To find this out, you must use <strong>attitudinal data<\/strong> or, to put it simply, customer satisfaction data.<\/p>\n<p>Customer satisfaction can be measured with indicators. There are several available:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Net Promoter Score (NPS)<\/strong> which measures the likelihood of your customers recommending you to others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 346px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/net-promoter-score.jpg\" alt=\"NPS question\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)<\/strong> which measures customer satisfaction after a specific interaction: exchanges with customer services, orders, purchases, delivery, in-store experience, etc.<\/li>\n<li>The <strong>Customer Effort Score (CES)<\/strong> which measures how much effort your customer has to exert to complete an action in the customer journey.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Read our article about these <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/csat-nps-ces-right-metric-for-superior-cx\/\">3 key customer satisfaction indicators<\/a> here<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The MyFeelBack &lt;&gt; Splio connector allows you to <strong>integrate these indicators into your customer files<\/strong>, so that Splio users can adapt their response and approach to the customer\u2019s satisfaction level.<\/p>\n<p>You can also synchronise your satisfaction indicators with your <strong>Splio dashboards<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 531px; height: 350px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/splio_1.png\" alt=\"Splio Dashboards\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><em>Photo credit :\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.splio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Splio<\/a>\u00a0<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Remember that a satisfaction indicator enables you to measure a specific customer\u2019s satisfaction (this information can be added to the customer file) and the overall level of satisfaction (this information can be added to your dashboards).<\/p>\n<h2>3 &#8211; Immediately handling customer dissatisfaction<\/h2>\n<p>A dissatisfied customer is an at-risk customer, on two levels:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customer dissatisfaction is a factor of <strong>attrition<\/strong>, or churn. You risk losing a customer.<\/li>\n<li>A dissatisfied customer is far more likely to share their dissatisfaction with others than a satisfied customer. You risk having your <strong>brand image<\/strong> tarnished and losing potential customers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For these two reasons, it is really important to <strong>handle customer dissatisfaction right away<\/strong>, meaning as soon as it is expressed by the customer. The MyFeelBack &lt;&gt; Splio connector makes this possible.<\/p>\n<p>Has a customer expressed dissatisfaction in a survey with a poor rating (for example an NPS below 5 or a CSAT below 2)? Then you can set up an automatically triggered customer service alert in Splio so that your agents can call the customer back or deploy a marketing scenario.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 577px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/alert-bad-satisfaction-score.jpg\" alt=\"alert of bad satisfaction score\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Customer answers to your MyFeelBack surveys can be used as <strong>triggers<\/strong> for your marketing actions.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>We have presented three good reasons to use the MyFeelBack &lt;&gt; Splio connector if you work with this Marketing CRM. We believe that each one is reason enough! Do you agree? We can help you set up the connector if you wish.
