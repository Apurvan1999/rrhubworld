Yet knowing your customers remains <strong>essential <\/strong>to be able to keep providing them in the best fitted way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you are fully managing your customer knowledge strategy and not missing out on these four <strong>key benefits<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\">1- Knowing your customers increases Customer Loyalty<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>customer-centric<\/strong> organization knows what its customers want and expect, because they asks them. Who better can tell you what they want, than the one that has the need?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers need and want businesses to <strong>keep their word<\/strong>, meaning they do the things they promise to do. Therefore, a customer-centric business must be honest and face the facts: How reliable are you in regards to your promises? Do you understand when or how often you are breaking them? Do you always meet customers expectations?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding customer perceptions and <strong>aligning your practices<\/strong> with those expectations can dramatically increase customer satisfaction, and therefore your sales and success.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-loyalty.jpg\" alt=\"customer knowledge\" width=\"650\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>An organization becomes customer-centric when its customers begin to say, \u201cHey, <strong>they really get me<\/strong>\u201d, words which should make any CEO happy. These are the words of a customer who is likely to remain loyal, a customer who will think twice before jumping ships to a <strong>competitor holding out a similar product<\/strong> or service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, today\u2019s market provides the customer with a variety of unique and high-quality <strong>shopping experiences<\/strong>.&nbsp;It pays to ask customers what they like and don\u2019t like, and tailor goods and services to meet those tastes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more about <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/how-netflix-rose-from-the-ashes-by-becoming-customer-centric\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>how Netflix rose from the ashes by becoming customer-centric<\/strong><\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers buy from people they like, people who listen to them and inspire trust to them, not someone. With this in mind, a customer-centric business can catapult itself above the competition because its customers are likely to remain happy. And<strong> happy customers are loyal customers<\/strong>, who&#8217;s<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>satisfaction can help a business reap benefits for years to come.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">2- Having a deeper sense of customer knowledge will create Growth Opportunities<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumer-centricity is not only good for the consumer but also the business.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Customer-centricity focuses a company, shaping operations that place customers at the <strong>heart of every decision<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/span> &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/growth-opportunities.jpeg\" alt=\"customer knowledge\" width=\"650\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p> &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It dialogues with its customers through&nbsp;smart surveys,&nbsp;in order to gain insights into customer&nbsp;<strong>trends and preferences<\/strong>, but also crucial<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>information for building innovation and longevity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart surveys are particularly effective as they help a business <strong>build a relationship<\/strong> with the consumer, providing various insights into who the consumer is. For instance smart surveys can help with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>providing a business with information about consumer buying <strong>behavior, interests, and engagement<\/strong>.<\/li><li>helping a business <strong>locate opportunities<\/strong> to initiate new products and services.<\/li><li>segmenting customers based on spending <strong>patterns.<\/strong><\/li><li>saving at-risk customer relationships and identifying <strong>promoters\/detractors<\/strong> of your brand. &nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers will tell an organization what they want.

A recent report published by Deloitte revealed that, customer-centric companies were <strong>60% more profitable<\/strong> than businesses which were not customer-centric.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional business transformation takes a <strong>top-down approach<\/strong>. It begins with business insiders and subject matter experts, making decisions which propel the direction a company will take. There is nothing inherently wrong with this model, as business leaders are typically in the best position to understand the <strong>complex inner processes<\/strong> of an organization.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/smart-businesses.jpg\" alt=\"customer knowledge\" width=\"650\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>But as effective as this approach may be, leaders are still forced to contend with the difficulties of understanding which issues and objectives should be made <strong>priority<\/strong>. This&nbsp;is exactly why a customer-centric <strong>business model <\/strong>is helpful, it pushes you to do more and better.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\">4- Constant Improvement, thanks to collected data and knowledge management<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking the<strong> right question at the right time<\/strong> will provide invaluable insights which help drive change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The information gathered in a smart survey can be distilled, providing a business with an overall picture of a <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.fromdoppler.com\/customer-journey-map-como-crear-uno\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">customer\u2019s journey<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This journey can be broken down to provide a <strong>clear understanding<\/strong> of the customer experience: what is working and what isn\u2019t, what is easy and what is painful.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, a business can begin to solve problems and improve upon existing strengths, both of which provide an <strong>immediate benefit<\/strong> to the customer.
