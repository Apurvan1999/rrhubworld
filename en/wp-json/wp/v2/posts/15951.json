This, of course, leaves a lot of room for improvement. A sure fire way to set yourself apart from your competition is to provide customers with friendly, knowledgeable, and easy-to-use customer support. If you can provide a consistent and relevant experience, you will give your customers no reason to complain or, worse, look for a better option. And there is always a better option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-18970 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-satisfied-experience.jpg\" alt=\"how-satisfied-experience\" width=\"650\" height=\"465\"><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">2&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;Customers will appreciate that you are invested in helping them<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The number one reason why customers leave a business is not, as many assume, because they found a better price. The U.S. Small Business Administration and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce report that <strong>68% of customers leave a business because they are upset with the treatment they&#8217;ve received from companies who seem indifferent to their wants and needs<\/strong>. Of course one way you can make sure you are meeting those wants and needs is to ask, over time, for feedback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\">3&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;And they will be more invested in helping you<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers will provide you with feedback if it means you can provide them with a more efficient and relevant experience. And, in fact, that\u2019s just what many businesses are doing. According to Gartner, <strong>brands which are most successful at delivering a superior customer experience are those who regularly implement <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/cx-management-en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customer experience<\/a> improvements based on customer feedback<\/strong>. Feedback provides them with insights into how their customers actually think and behave, making it easier to plan, create, and improve the customer experience for maximum payoff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/meet-cusomer-expectations.jpg\" alt=\"Improvement based on customer satisfaction\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\">4&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;Happy customers will help you attract new business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, consumers regularly read reviews before they make a purchasing decision. Search Engine Land reports that about <strong>85% of consumers read as many as 10 online reviews just to determine whether or not they can trust a business<\/strong>. With these kinds of numbers, the last thing you want is for potential customers to stumble across negative reviews of your business. Survey your customers to find out what they like about you and don\u2019t shy away from sharing their feedback. Let your most satisfied customers be your business\u2019s biggest advocates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap5\">5 \u2014 Happy customers will help you improve consumer confidence<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>eMarketer finds that while consumers are eager to purchase products from brands they know and love, <strong>they place less importance on product descriptions offered by manufacturers and more on the opinions of other consumers<\/strong> who have actually used the products. For this reason, you should not only make sure that all of your customers are satisfied with your offerings but also ask your customers to share their positive opinions.&nbsp; And, again, be sure to prominently highlight those opinions on social media and your website! You\u2019ll build more trust and, as an added bonus, even improve your SEO ranking!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-18971 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/mobile-responsive-1.jpg\" alt=\"mobile-responsive\" width=\"650\" height=\"434\"><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap6\">6 \u2014 Happy customers are more likely to remain loyal<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Forrester reports that <strong>81% of customers are more likely to engage in repeat business with companies that exceed their expectations<\/strong>. What this means is that much of your business\u2019 growth is likely to stem from focusing on retention. You will not only spend less on acquiring customers, but improve your chances of selling more \u2013 and at higher costs \u2013 to your existing customer base. Investing in the design and delivery of a superior experience will pay for itself when you see your customers returning time and again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap7\">7&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;Measuring satisfaction doesn\u2019t have to be hard<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Measuring customer satisfaction doesn\u2019t have to be chore. There are a number or easy-to-use but effective metrics you can use to ensure that your customers are happy with the design and delivery of your customer experience. Simple metrics like CSAT, CES, and NPS have become increasingly popular as they provide reliable data businesses can use to assess both their current performance and future prospects. In their own ways, each metric will help you understand what you need to do to improve your customer experience, increase retention, and beat the competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Encouraging customers to provide you with feedback is an integral part of delivering and maintaining a superior customer experience. <strong>Routinely requesting, analyzing, and implementing their feedback<\/strong> will ensure that you are aware of your strengths, able to address your weaknesses, and always stay on top of whatever expectations your customers have of you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/20304540\/50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1.png\" alt=\"15 questions to know your customers needs and expectations\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Customers want to feel valued and it\u2019s your ability to make them feel that way time and again which will enable you to win their long term happiness and loyalty, not to mention differentiate yourself in today\u2019s increasingly crowded marketplace.
