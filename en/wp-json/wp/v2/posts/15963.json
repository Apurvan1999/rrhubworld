Customers expect you to understand their needs, wants, and expectations, and how well you do this will determine the value of your customer experience.<\/p>\n<h2>Creating the Ultimate Feedback Survey<\/h2>\n<p>Whether they are delivered via email, mobile, or your online site, the questions you ask on your feedback survey can be adapted to attain information about new or repeat customers, a specific point in their buying journey, or their entire experience.<\/p>\n<p>Some broad questions that you can start with include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201c<em>How satisfied are you?<\/em>\u201d to gather feedback about a current product or service. You can also ask the <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/grow-your-business-with-net-promoter-score\/\">NPS Score question<\/a> of \u201c<em>How likely are you to recommend our product\/service to a friend or family member?<\/em>\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201c<em>What is your primary motivation for using our product\/service?<\/em>\u201d to find out what your customers\u2019 primary motivations are and what they are doing on your site.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201c<em>What do you like most\/least about our product?<\/em>\u201d to fine tune your marketing to promote the features customers value most.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And to gather more specific information:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201c<em>On a scale of 1 \u2013 5, how would you describe your experience using our product\/service?<\/em>\u201d along with a quick follow up question about specific features or purchases.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201c<em>What made you choose us over our competitors?<\/em>\u201d to gain insight into your unique strengths.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201c<em>How would you describe our product\/service to a friend or family member?<\/em>\u201d to help you design better marketing campaigns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Regardless of the questions you ask, your goal should be two-fold: (1) <strong>provide customers with an opportunity to tell you how satisfied they are<\/strong> and (2) <strong>gather insights into your customers which improves your ability to attract, sell to, and prevent them from abandoning you for a competitor<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>Smart Survey Benefits<\/h2>\n<p>Companies which can satisfy their customers\u2019 values and needs are more likely to come out ahead. Having access to the right customer information, such as that gathered through feedback surveys, and using that information to create a meaningful customer experience is the only way to strengthen customer loyalty and establish a true mark of differentiation.<\/p>\n<p>Among their benefits, surveys:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let you see how customers view your company\u2019s offerings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide insights into how you compare to your competitors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Deliver unfiltered impressions, whether positive or not-so-positive, about your customer experiences.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Paint a clearer picture of your customers and their changing needs and perceptions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Any business will tell you that knowing who your customers are\u00a0 &#8211; <em>and not just on a superficial or demographic level<\/em> &#8211; is fundamental for business success.
