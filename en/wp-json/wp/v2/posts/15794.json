How can you make your online events more appealing and more efficient?<\/p>\n<p>Well, you can start by measuring your participants\u2019 satisfaction!<\/p>\n<p>This article will present you with a few ideas to efficiently measure your participants\u2019 satisfaction with your online events. We will list 10 questions that you can include in your satisfaction survey.<\/p>\n<h2>A Few Tips to Measure Satisfaction with an Online Event<\/h2>\n<p>Here are 3 key tips to measure and manage the satisfaction of participants to your online events.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip 1 \u2013 Send Surveys Immediately After the Event<\/h3>\n<p>We often come back to this, and the tip applies to most surveys \u2013 you should always favour <strong>\u201cimmediate\u201d surveys<\/strong>, meaning deployed shortly after the event or interaction you want to measure. And therefore avoid \u201cdelayed\u201d surveys, sent out of context several months later!<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 399px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/post-event-satisfaction.jpg\" alt=\"Online event satisfaction scale\"><\/p>\n<p>For example, if you want to measure your call centre agents\u2019 ability to handle customer requests quickly and efficiently, your satisfaction survey should be sent to the customer a few seconds after the interaction.<\/p>\n<p>This piece of advice also applies to measuring satisfaction with online events. You should send your survey quickly after the event to measure overall satisfaction with your online event, whether a show, conference, webinar, masterclass, online seminar, etc. \u201cQuickly after\u201d means a few hours after, or 2 to 3 days later at the very most.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip 2 \u2013 Consider Deploying Short &#8220;Snapshot&#8221; Satisfaction Surveys<\/h3>\n<p>You can also send \u201csnapshot\u201d, or \u201clive\u201d satisfaction surveys, which will provide you with even more immediate feedback that those sent immediately after an event. To do so, send your survey <strong>during the event.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The idea is to measure the participants\u2019 interest in the event as it unfolds, and to measure how this interest evolves. This is an excellent way of identifying areas for improvement for your online events and your participants\u2019 preferences.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 440px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/satisfaction-event-en-ligne.jpg\" alt=\"Online events satisfction\"><\/p>\n<p>These &#8220;live&#8221; surveys should of course be deployed on a suitable channel: event website or platform, SMS, mobile app.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip 3 \u2013 Adjust the Length of your Surveys<\/h3>\n<p>As explained above, you can choose between two different survey formats to measure satisfaction with your online events:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&#8220;Immediate&#8221; surveys<\/strong>, sent shortly after the end of an online event: a few minutes, hours, or at the most, days later. The aim is to measure the satisfaction of participants with the online event as a whole, providing a general overview.<\/li>\n<li><strong>&#8220;Live&#8221;<\/strong> surveys&nbsp;or &#8220;snapshot\u201d surveys sent during the online event.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Immediate and live surveys don\u2019t follow the same logic.<\/p>\n<p>Surveys sent immediately after an event can be longer and measure everything at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall satisfaction with the event and its organisation.<\/li>\n<li>Satisfaction with specific aspects, such as the content\/presentation of a specific session.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These surveys can include 6 to 7 questions, or even more. Below are some examples of questions to include in your surveys.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Live&#8221; surveys, on the other hand, sent during an event, should be very short. They should not disturb the participant\u2019s experience. We recommend limiting these surveys to one simple question, <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/csat-works-customer-experience-high-priority-metric\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>the CSAT question<\/strong><\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>&#8220;Are you satisfied with [the current event or session]?&#8221;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 316px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/formule-calculate-csat.jpg\" alt=\"CSAT how to calculate\"><\/p>\n<p>The participant should be able to answer quickly, in a single click. We recommend using a graphic rating scale, with smiley faces for example.<\/p>\n<h2>10+ Examples of Satisfaction Questions to Ask Participants to your Online Events<\/h2>\n<p>Remember that these surveys aim to measure participant satisfaction with your online event. The objective is to identify areas for improvement &amp; progress for your next online events.<\/p>\n<p>You should therefore make a list of all the items likely to influence your participants\u2019 satisfaction. Below are a few example of classic questions, that apply to most online events.<\/p>\n<h3>Question 1 &#8211; How would you rate the event as a whole?<\/h3>\n<p>One of the advantages of post-event surveys, is that the respondent can take a step back and rate the event as a whole. Participants will have had time to reflect on their experience of the event. We recommend asking them about how they rate the overall event with this first question.<\/p>\n<h3>Question 2 \u2013 On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this event to a friend or colleague? (NPS)<\/h3>\n<p>This question consists in measuring your participants\u2019 likelihood to recommend your events to their family and friends (B2C) or colleagues (B2B). This is the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/complete-guide-net-promoter-score-nps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NPS<\/a>\u201d question that we often talk about on the MyFeelBack blog. The Net Promoter Score is a valuable satisfaction indicator, with lots of use cases.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 469px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/nps-online-event.jpg\" alt=\"NPS online events\"><\/p>\n<h3>Question 3 \u2013 What did you think of the quality of the talks?<\/h3>\n<p>This question goes into a bit more detail. The quality of the talks is key to a successful event, whether online or in person.<\/p>\n<p>If your online event has several speakers and sessions, you can use a matrix and checkbox system to enable participants to rate each talk more quickly.<\/p>\n<h3>Question 4 \u2013 How would you rate the management of the event schedule?<\/h3>\n<p>Were the talks\/sessions on time? Were there any delays? Or last minute changes? This is not a trivial question to ask participants to your event. Time-keeping is key to a successful event.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 527px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/csat-online-meetings.jpg\" alt=\"CSAT online events\"><\/p>\n<h3>Question 5 \u2013 How would you rate the length of the event?<\/h3>\n<p>This question completes the last one. It allows to assess the timings of your event: was it too long? Too short? Satisfactory? The answers to this question will help you improve the format of your next online events.<\/p>\n<h3>Question 6 \u2013 What did you enjoy the most about this online event?<\/h3>\n<p>This simple question will help you identify your event\u2019s strong points. You could ask this as:<\/p>\n<p>A closed question with several possible answers to choose from.<\/p>\n<p>An open question.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 428px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/satisfaction-online-meetings.jpg\" alt=\"Satisfaction online meetings\"><\/p>\n<h3>Question 7 \u2013 What did you enjoy the least about this event?<\/h3>\n<p>It is also important to identify the weaknesses of your event, or the things that your participants were less pleased with. This will help you identify areas for improvement and to better understand your target audience\u2019s expectations and preferences.<\/p>\n<h3>Questions 8, 9 and 10 \u2013 3 questions to measure customer effort (CES)<\/h3>\n<p>We suggest asking three questions to measure the effort your participants put into accessing and taking part in the event. We suggest using the Customer Effort Score indicator, or CES. This indicator is not as well-known as the NPS, but it is widely used. It enables to measure the level of effort spent by the respondent to accomplish a given task. It is the perfect indicator for identifying irritants and friction on the customer journey.<\/p>\n<p>The CES question can be phrased as follows:<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>\u201cHow much effort did you have to put in to [Action]?\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Below are three examples of how this question can be used to measure satisfaction with an online event. \u201cHow much effort did you have to put in to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accessing information about the event? (Question 8)<\/li>\n<li>Signing up to the event? (Question 9)<\/li>\n<li>Connecting to the event platform? (Question 10)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2 Bonus Questions to Complete the Survey<\/h3>\n<p>We recommend ending your post-event survey with an open-ended question that will enable you to collect verbatims from your participants. Here are two examples of open-ended questions (one is enough!):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In your opinion, how could we improve our future online events?<\/li>\n<li>Do you have any suggestions or comments to add about the event?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You now have everything you need to deploy post-online event surveys. We hope that you found this article useful.
