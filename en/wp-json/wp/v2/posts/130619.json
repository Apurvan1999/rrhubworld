In other words, the information that is transmitted among the brand&#8217;s own consumers. As if it is a friend, we tend to <strong>trust consumers who have already tried a product or service more<\/strong> than the information we receive about it through traditional advertising.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/local-consumer-review-survey\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>Customer Reviews<\/span><\/strong><\/a> BrightLocal LocalSurvey 91% of Millennials -, between the 25 and 40 &#8211; <strong>trust online reviews as much as they trust their friends and family<\/strong>. And <strong>86% of customers say they read reviews of local businesses before using their services<\/strong> : you&#8217;ve got one of the most powerful marketing tools a brand has.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What do we mean by recommendation?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In our daily life, we talk about product recommendation when someone we know tells us about the <strong>benefits of a product or service based on their own experience<\/strong>. The success of these recommendations is therefore based on two aspects:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The <strong>veracity of the testimony<\/strong>, because there is direct proof that the product\/service was used.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The <strong>bond of trust<\/strong> that exists between the two people.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By extrapolating this real situation to the digital world, we find that users are trying to <strong>replace this bond of trust with seeking opinions<\/strong>, <strong>recommendations and<\/strong> <a href=\"\/en\/consumer-reviews-must-have-brands\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>online notice<\/span><\/strong><\/a> to help them make decisions.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Also, according to the study cited above, <\/span><strong>the vast majority of users read an average of 10 online reviews before making a decision. <\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Then, <\/span><strong>50% of users who have read a positive review take action, <\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">for example by going to the company&#8217;s online store.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What benefits can referral marketing bring to my business?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As we have seen, recommendation marketing can be <strong>a fundamental tool for your business<\/strong>. Among the benefits it represents include the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Attract new prospects and customers<\/strong> who also come with a positive perception of your brand.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Lower Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): <\/strong>&nbsp;Campaigns reviews don&#8217;t require a large investment, it&#8217;s more about establishing the right strategy. However, the more visible the impact on your results will be, the more your conversion rate will increase and consequently reduce your CAC.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To give you an idea of \u200b\u200bhow important reviews are to your business, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.capterra.com\/b2b-software-reviews-infographic\" style=\"color: #8272fa;\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>Capterra<\/span><\/strong><\/a><strong> conducted an anonymous<\/strong> survey of people who read reviews of software products. The result is clear: <strong>98% of those surveyed said their<\/strong><span> <\/span><a href=\"\/en\/benefits-social-shopping-influencer-marketing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>buying decision <\/span><\/strong><\/a><strong>was influenced by the reviews they read<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 32px;\"><strong>The Basics of a Referral Marketing Strategy<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As we have seen, one of the fundamental aspects of referral marketing is <strong>that reviews and opinions are sincere and come naturally<\/strong>. So, there is no question of leaving to chance when managing a recommendation marketing strategy: nothing could be further from the truth.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is possible to create a recommendation marketing strategy by implementing different actions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Encourage the user <strong>to share information about the product or service through incentives<\/strong>. For example, reward <strong>promotional codes or discounts <\/strong>the user&#8217;s followers who register through a specific link. This action is easily carried out thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hivency.com\/en\/your-needs\/generate-consumer-reviews\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>consumer review campaigns<\/span><\/strong><\/a> : participants receive <strong>a product to test for free in exchange for an <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hivency.com\/en\/plateforme\/ratings-and-reviews\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>honest and sincere opinion<\/span><\/strong><\/a> posted on various e-commerce sites. At Hivency, brands can <strong>conduct this type of campaign directly on the platform in<\/strong> order to <strong>collect verified reviews<\/strong> (via full testimonials, videos, or even audio recordings) and <strong>strengthen consumers&#8217; confidence in them.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Make it easy for the user to <strong>share the product with their friends with just one click.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Request a rating directly<\/strong>. This would be the case of mobile applications in which, after a certain time of use, the user is invited to take a few seconds to assess the benefits of the application.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Use the<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hivency.com\/en\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>influencer marketing<\/span><\/strong><\/a><span style=\"color: #8272fa;\">.<\/span> In this case, a series of influencers, <a href=\"\/en\/how-to-find-and-collaborate-with-nano-influencers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>nano-influencers<\/span><\/strong><\/a><strong> or consumers close to<\/strong> the values \u200b\u200band type of communication of the brand are selected and receive products in exchange of honest comments on one or more pages of merchant sites.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This last action is perhaps the one that can bring the most benefits to a brand, since <strong>recommendations from influencers are most similar to a direct recommendation from a friend<\/strong>. They therefore have a strong impact on users and generally lead <strong>to good results<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Identifying the <strong>referral marketing actions<\/strong> most relevant for your brand is the first step in creating a strategy. Remember <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">that<\/span> <span style=\"color: #999999; font-weight: normal;\">working with influencers <\/span>is a good way <strong>to improve your bond of trust with the consumer.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 7px;\">Photo credits: @myleon via Unsplash<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How many times have you heard that there is no better marketing than word of mouth ?
