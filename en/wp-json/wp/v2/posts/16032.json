When selling a luxury item or service, you are well aware that you are selling an experience and convenience just as much as you are selling a good or service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that at any point, if the experience becomes less than luxury, the customer will walk away from your brand without hesitation. Because selling luxury means selling customer experience, initiating innovative opportunities for customer feedback is a must.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Customer feedback is your quick access guide to improving your customer experience.<\/strong> When customers provide you with their opinions on how you are doing, they are giving you <strong>valuable access into how to improve your company and sell more<\/strong>. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the feedback is good or bad, it can be used to your advantage if you know how to properly analyze and act on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luxury sector companies need to use this tool in order <strong>to keep their companies on track and keeping their customers happy<\/strong>. Here are 4 tips on how to use customer feedback to improve your luxury customer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\">1. Find where your luxury customers live their virtual experience<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to better access your customers, and therefore get relevant feedback, is by finding out <strong>how they use social media<\/strong>. Luxury customers have different habits than generic customers, and it will take some research to figure out <strong>what social media channels they prefer<\/strong>. Once you have figured out which social media channel to focus on (Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin, or the ever-popular Facebook) you can send out promotional posts where you link to a customer feedback survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also possible to link from your chatbot at the end of a conversation on Messenger for example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">2. Luxury customer experience feedback start with giveaways<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing to be aware of when you are collecting feedback from a luxury audience is to be smart about any <a href=\"http:\/\/business.time.com\/2013\/06\/24\/5-ways-companies-win-by-giving-stuff-away\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">giveaways <\/a>that you offer. Giveaways or freebies are a common &#8220;reward&#8221; that companies give out to customers who have completed their survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, <strong>giveaways differ a little bit when working with a luxury audience<\/strong>. You cannot give away something that is easy to acquire with a luxury item giveaway post, because the vast majority of your customers won&#8217;t be motivated by this sort of giveaway. Giving away something too generic may actually harm your brand identity. If you are offering a giveaway, <strong>it&#8217;s best to giveaway something from your brand <\/strong>(a rebate for a service or a free product) and make sure that <strong>the giveaway has a value for your customers.<\/strong> &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/luxury-sector-customer-experience-popin.jpg\" alt=\"survey customer experience\" class=\"wp-image-19555\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\">3. Ask the right questions in your customer experience survey<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you decide to survey your luxury customers, make sure you are asking <strong>the right questions<\/strong>. Your goal is to make sure that the customer experience is as seamless and satisfying as possible. So, your questions should inquire about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.simplypsychology.org\/qualitative-quantitative.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">qualitative data<\/a> like the outcome of recent interactions that your customer has had with your company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, you also are looking to find out <strong>how healthy your brand image is<\/strong>, and so you need to ask some questions that are more qualitative and inquire about how your customer feels about your brand. Here are some examples of quantitative and qualitative questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>How would you rate the latest interaction you had with our company on a scale of 1-5?<\/em><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/luxury-customer-experience.jpg\" alt=\"nps question in customer experience survey\" class=\"wp-image-19551\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>What is one thing our specialists can improve upon to bring you a better customer experience?<\/em> &nbsp;<\/li><li><em>What feelings do you associate with our brand?<\/em><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/luxury-sector-customer-experience-question.jpg\" alt=\"survey questions\" class=\"wp-image-19556\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Are you happy to be a customer of our company? Why or why not?<\/em><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/luxury-sector-customer-experience-emoji.jpg\" alt=\"emoji survey\" class=\"wp-image-19553\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Do you feel like associating with our brand offers you a community of like-minded people?<\/em><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-experience-survey.jpg\" alt=\"customer experience question\" class=\"wp-image-19550\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\">4. The Net Promoter Score survey is inescapable in the luxury industry<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are surveying your luxury customers, you may want to consider trying the Net Promoter Score survey as a way of<strong> getting a feel for how you are doing and what improvements you can make <\/strong>to your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Net Promoter Score survey is an interesting option for the luxury sector because it is :<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Very fast and convenient to take &nbsp;<\/li><li>Very effective at providing accurate results<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/7-kpis-to-measure-your-customer-experience-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NPS<\/a> survey consists only of one question: \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><em>On a Scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend our services to a friend or family member? What is your reason for this score?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/luxury-sector-customer-experience-nps.jpg\" alt=\"nps question on website\" class=\"wp-image-19554\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br>This question is especially relevant for the luxury sector because <strong>you want to know what kind of reputation your product or service has developed with your consumer base<\/strong>. If your luxury customers are likely to recommend your product or service to their friends and families, this means that their friends and families are also luxury customers and that your company&#8217;s brand is making a positive impact in this sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;What is your reason for this score?&#8221; question is an optional add-on, but when your customers take the time to fill it out, it can be of immense benefit<strong>.<\/strong> It helps you to<strong> understand the reason why your customers do or do not feel comfortable recommending your brand.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Selling to luxury customers is all about being accessible while remaining exclusive. Your feedback options should be no exception. Make sure you are surveying your customers on channels that they like and are comfortable on, that you are not overwhelming them with questions, and that you get to the bottom of how they feel about your brand and what you can do to refine it further.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-18b20ddf-9442-4e43-96fd-b04fe925544b\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-18b20ddf-9442-4e43-96fd-b04fe925544b\" id=\"hs-cta-18b20ddf-9442-4e43-96fd-b04fe925544b\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/20304540\/18b20ddf-9442-4e43-96fd-b04fe925544b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-18b20ddf-9442-4e43-96fd-b04fe925544b\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" height=\"231\" width=\"700\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/18b20ddf-9442-4e43-96fd-b04fe925544b.png\" alt=\"Memo 15+ examples of open-ended questions\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(20304540, '18b20ddf-9442-4e43-96fd-b04fe925544b', {\"useNewLoader\":\"true\",\"region\":\"na1\"}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When marketing to customers of a luxury brand, delivering an enjoyable customer experience is one of the most important things to consider.
