Brand content, on the other hand, is content that is traditionally created by the brands themselves. When a web user posts a photo, a video, a comment, a review, or an answer on a forum that relates to your brand in some way, they\u2019ve created content and are contributing to the visibility of your brand and products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So what are the types of UGC you can leverage in your marketing right now to build trust and drive sales?<\/strong> Here\u2019s an overview of the user-generated content currently available to you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\"><strong>\u2014 Text-based UGC, the \u201ctraditional\u201d format<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Image-Lacoste-USA-reviews.png\" alt=\"Text-based UGC\" class=\"wp-image-664\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers are increasingly keen to share their experiences. International market research group IFOP reports that 90% of consumers read customer reviews before deciding to buy something online! And according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/lehub.laposte.fr\/interview\/impact-avis-clients-decrypte-skeepersavis-verifies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recent survey on online reviews<\/a>, reviews&nbsp;consultations have&nbsp;increased&nbsp;by an&nbsp;average&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>45%<\/strong>&nbsp;since&nbsp;2020. These reviews are conversion levers \u2013 not just on e-commerce sites, but also on search engines, since these now include star ratings in their search results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"forums-and-blogs\"><strong>Forums and blogs<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Forums and blogs are important user-generated content platforms. <strong>Because search engines love long-form content, these pages easily rank higher<\/strong>, putting them in a strong position to influence the decisions of consumers who research online before pulling the trigger on a purchase. The Q&amp;A forum Quora receives 300 million unique visitors each month and answers ultra-specific questions from web users about all sorts of topics. People visit the forum looking for anything from theoretical and academic knowledge to feedback on consumer goods or the products and services of major brands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Image-2-article-9-types-UGC.png\" alt=\"UGC for marketing strategy\" class=\"wp-image-665\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"q-a\"><strong>Q&amp;A<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, <strong>many brands co-create their Q&amp;A sections with their customers<\/strong>. This allows them to identify the questions that are truly important to their consumers, improve their understanding of their audiences, and provide useful answers to their communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, every three months, Airbnb hosts a Q&amp;A session with its community of hosts to answer any questions they have. These <a href=\"https:\/\/community.withairbnb.com\/t5\/Host-Q-A\/idb-p\/2018-q3-en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Q&amp;A sessions<\/a> are then published on the Airbnb community website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Image-3-article-9-types-UGC.png\" alt=\"AirBnB UGC\" class=\"wp-image-666\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"community-chats\"><strong>Community chats<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Community chats or C2C chats are starting to spring up on e-commerce sites. They\u2019re small chat windows that pop up during your visit. Until recently, there was always a customer service rep on the other end. But now, some brands are offering solutions that are similar to a traditional chat, only <strong>with a customer on the other end<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Image-feelunique-ENG.png\" alt=\"community chats\" class=\"wp-image-667\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\"><strong>\u2014 User-generated photos are all over social media<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-classic-social-platforms-are-teeming-with-user-generated-photos\"><strong>The classic social platforms are teeming with user-generated photos<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest (among others) are an endless sources of user-generated photos. In 2017 alone, 1.2 billion photos were taken, 85% of them with a smartphone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, there are photo curation tools available to capture all this content and share it on brands\u2019 marketing channels and platforms (walls, social media, product pages, etc.).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because consumers (and marketers) are tired of stock photos, user-generated photos are a great alternative. In fact, sometimes they\u2019re a brand\u2019s top choice for communicating with authentic and striking images.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"new-players-specializing-in-user-generated-photos-for-e-commerce\"><strong>New players specializing in user-generated photos for e-commerce<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You might\u2019ve heard of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.21buttons.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">21 Buttons<\/a>? It\u2019s a social network founded in Barcelona in 2015 and available in France since 2018. A cross between a social media platform and a marketplace, this network allows consumers \u2013 or \u201cButtoners\u201d \u2013 to post their looks and earn a commission from the sales they generate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\"><strong>\u2014 User-generated audio content, still in its infancy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, user-generated audio hadn\u2019t really caught on yet.

So it\u2019s becoming really easy to share a review or an experience with a product or service to guide other consumers in their buying decisions. As an example, here\u2019s a video of a customer sharing his experience of a product he bought on the Cultura website:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Sans-titre-7.gif\" alt=\"Cultura UGC marketing strategy\" class=\"wp-image-1445\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"unboxings-and-hauls\"><strong>Unboxings and hauls<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 18 million unboxing and haul videos were uploaded to YouTube in 2018.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Appearing for the first time in 2006, an unboxing is when someone films themselves opening a recently-bought product and sharing their experience on social media. From the technical features to the packaging, everything is covered in detail. Haul videos are based on the same principle: vloggers present the purchases (cosmetics, clothing, homewares, etc.) they\u2019ve just pulled out of their shopping bags.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these types of videos used to be the preserve of influencers, they\u2019ve now become widespread and many consumers are sharing their shopping experiences in videos online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tutorials-and-how-tos\"><strong>Tutorials and how-tos<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here the approach is more educational: consumers share their videos to explain how to use a product.

In 2018, it was the fourth most downloaded non-gaming app in the world on the <strong>Apple Store<\/strong> and <strong>Google Play<\/strong>, ahead of Instagram and <strong>Snapchat<\/strong>. The app allows users to create 15-second video clips to music, and it is representative of a new type of short video app that took the Chinese market by storm two years ago and has now spread to the USA and Europe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, user-generated videos are evolving and changing. With each new format, consumers are getting more and more used to making videos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap5\"><strong>\u2014 TLDR.
