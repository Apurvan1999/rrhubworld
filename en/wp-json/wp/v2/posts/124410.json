But all campaigns are not created equal and you shouldn\u2019t be using influencer marketing campaigns as a catch-all to meet all your goals. Influencer marketing campaigns are only as effective as the planning behind them.<\/p>\n<p>Certain influencers, platforms, and types of campaigns are better for one type of goal versus another. Each of your influencer marketing campaigns should have a goal that\u2019s unique to that campaign and has its own set of key performance indicators (KPIs). Once you know what your goals are for a campaign, it\u2019s time to find the right influencers to help optimize campaign performance.<\/p>\n<p>When looking for influencers, most marketers already know that vetting influencers is key. You want to make sure any potential influencers are a fit for your brand values, mission, and aesthetic and that their followers are in your target audience. However, not everyone thinks about targeting influencers based on specific campaign KPIs. Once you set your campaign goals, you need to adjust your parameters for targeting influencers to make sure you\u2019re leveraging the right influencers for your campaigns.<\/p>\n<h2>For brand awareness, go macro<\/h2>\n<p>If you want more people to know about your brand and increase your reach and brand awareness, you need numbers. Whether you\u2019re launching a new brand or product or re-branding an existing company or product, you want to reach as many people in your target audience as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Macro-influencers are a good fit for these types of campaigns and you can partner with just a few to get the word out faster, versus using twice as many micro-influencers. When you find your influencers and start working with them, you can track the impact on brand awareness by watching website traffic, referral traffic, earned media value, share of voice, and whatever other KPIs you\u2019ve determined for the campaign.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Micro influencers get macro engagement<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you want to drive increased engagement with your influencer marketing campaigns, nano and micro-influencers can help you achieve that goal the best. While these types of influencers have a smaller audience, their followers are typically very loyal and highly engaged. Look for influencers with consistently high engagement rates (aim for 10%) using a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/socialblade.com\/\">Social Blade<\/a> to calculate.<\/p>\n<p>Track engagement by measuring comments, shares, and hashtags. These campaigns are a good opportunity to create a campaign-specific hashtag to make tracking easier.<\/p>\n<p>Boost conversions with micro influencers<\/p>\n<p>When you want to use influencer marketing to increase your conversions, micro-influencers are also your best bet. Look for micro-influencers who have at least a 4% engagement rate and a high number of organic comments and replies. If you see an influencer using affiliate links in their captions, that\u2019s a bonus since it means they have experience recommending products to their audience and using these types of links.<\/p>\n<p>Another good thing to look for when targeting influencers to drive sales is finding influencers with popular, high-performing blogs or vlogs with healthy traffic. These influencers are likely to have engaged audiences who are interested and invested in recommendations from the influencers they follow.<\/p>\n<p>Get more interactions<\/p>\n<p>To drive more interactions, micro and macro-influencers with high engagement rates are going to be more effective than nano-influencers. You still want to look for high engagement rates and a lot of comments in addition to the influencers\u2019 follower counts. The higher the follower count, the lower the engagement tends to be, so it\u2019s important to find the balance with spreading the word about your brand to people who will actively engage with your content.<\/p>\n<p>Look at recent posts to see how many comments and replies they have to see how engaged their followers are. Be sure to find influencers that are in your niche and will be able to share your brand or product while remaining relevant and authentic to their followers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Create more content<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>User-generated content is a buzzword because it works. This type of content is seen as being more authentic and transparent than branded content. It also <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/strategic-content-marketing\/how-to-leverage-influencers-to-generate-ugc-at-scale-ac899d6df322\">drives more organic traffic<\/a> and increases trust for brands.\u00a0 If you want to create a lot of UGC, consider partnering with nano and micro-influencers who are in your niche and have a history of creating high-quality content that has healthy engagement from their followers.<\/p>\n<p>By partnering with several nano and\/or micro-influencers, you can generate a larger library of UGC in a short amount of time that you can then use for campaigns, ads, emails, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the goal of your influencer marketing campaign, you need to target influencers that will be most effective in reaching that goal. Nano and micro-influencers can help create content, drive engagement, but macro-influencers are best for boosting brand awareness and increasing reach. Setting the right goals and KPIs is the first step to figuring out which influencers are the best fit for your campaigns. Once you do that, you can start identifying influencers that have the right number of followers and engagement that are in your industry and fit with your overall brand style, values, and target audience.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Request a Demo<\/h2>\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_6  et_pb_text_align_justified et_pb_bg_layout_light\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Octoly makes it easy for brands to build authentic text reviews and amazing influencer content with product seeding campaigns at scale.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Related Articles<\/h2>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Influencer marketing campaigns can help you meet a variety of goals, from boosting conversions to growing brand awareness.
