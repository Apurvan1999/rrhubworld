It is calculated based on the&nbsp;answers, on a scale of 0 to 10, to this&nbsp;question:&nbsp;\u201cHow likely are you to recommend [Brand name, service, etc.] to others?\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/average-net-promoter-score-by-industry-scheme.jpg\" alt=\"scale for net promoter score\" class=\"wp-image-22545\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">Two NPS Use Cases&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NPS&nbsp;has two main functions. It allows to:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Sort your customers into 3 categories&nbsp;according to&nbsp;their NPS score. Customers who answer between 0 and 6 are your \u201cdetractors\u201d, those who choose 7 or 8 are \u201cneutrals\u201d, and those who rate you between 9 and 10 are your \u201cpromoters\u201d. This classification is very useful for better segmenting your customers and targeting your marketing actions.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Build&nbsp;an overall&nbsp;NPS score. This is the \u201cmacro\u201d NPS use case. The overall NPS score is calculated by&nbsp;subtracting&nbsp;the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. If you have 50% promoters and 30% detractors, your NPS score will be 20 (50 \u2013 30).&nbsp;Your&nbsp;NPS score can therefore vary on a scale of -100 to 100.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This article will focus on the second NPS use case. Knowing your company\u2019s NPS score enables you to measure your customers\u2019 overall level of satisfaction. But the question that immediately comes to mind is: \u201cWhat is a good NPS score?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\">What is a Good NPS Score?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NPS scores&nbsp;vary&nbsp;a lot from one sector to another. To know how \u201cgood\u201d your company\u2019s NPS score is, you need to compare it with&nbsp;other industry players\u2019&nbsp;average NPS score.&nbsp;There\u2019s no point comparing&nbsp;a professional training centre\u2019s NPS score with a software publisher\u2019s.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which leads us to another question, that indirectly&nbsp;helps&nbsp;to answer the first: \u201cWhat is the average NPS score for companies in my industry?\u201d.&nbsp;There\u2019s no easy way to answer this question. Several studies have been carried out,&nbsp;mainly&nbsp;in the US. Let\u2019s take a look at the results of a 2020 NPS Benchmark produced by Retently.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\">Net Promoter Score Benchmark by Industry&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"before-we-get-started\">Before we Get Started\u2026&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, several companies have carried out NPS benchmarks, such as the excellent&nbsp;Satmextrix.com&nbsp;NPS benchmark. The results are more or less consistent from on study to another, there are no major differences.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the NPS benchmark results&nbsp;stated below, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to investigate yourself too. You could for example, have a look at Customer Guru, which makes&nbsp;industry players\u2019&nbsp;NPS scores public.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/average-net-promoter-score-by.jpg\" alt=\"BMW's NPS\" class=\"wp-image-22549\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The NPS Benchmark produced by Retently was&nbsp;based on its own customer base. The first observation they made is that no industry has a negative NPS score. The average NPS scores range from 27 to 71.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The education and&nbsp;professional&nbsp;training sectors are top of the table with an average of 71, followed by the insurance industry (70) and ecommerce (62). The below table details the results for the other sectors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/average-net-promoter-score-by-industry-stats.jpg\" alt=\"Stats for the average net promoter score\" class=\"wp-image-22546\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The SaaS (cloud software publishers), logistics, transport and health&nbsp;industries&nbsp;come in last position.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again, NPS scores tend to be higher in the US than in France, although unfortunately there is still no French NPS benchmark that provides an exact measurement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible to draw some&nbsp;general&nbsp;conclusions though. For example, whatever your company or business, an NPS score below 0&nbsp;i.e.,&nbsp;a negative NPS, should be seen as a warning&nbsp;sign. You should be worried about this score. A score between 0 and 30 is an average, or&nbsp;very&nbsp;poor score if you\u2019re in the e-commerce and&nbsp;professional&nbsp;training&nbsp;industry. On the other end of the scale, an NPS score of 70&nbsp;is&nbsp;always very good and should even be considered as excellent if you work in an industry where the NPS is normally low.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap5\">How to&nbsp;Improve your average Net Promoter Score&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, this is the only question that matters! If your company\u2019s average Net Promoter Score is below or significantly inferior to that of your competitors, it is important to identify&nbsp;dysfunctions&nbsp;and build an action plan to&nbsp;resolve them. Below are three tips to help you&nbsp;with&nbsp;this approach.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-add-a-follow-up-question-to-your-average-net-promoter-score\">1 \u2013 Add a Follow-Up Question to your average Net Promoter Score&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The NPS question (\u201cHow likely are you to recommend\u2026?\u201d) reveals how your customers feel, but not the reasons&nbsp;they feel that way. It is important to know that a customer is unhappy (\u201cdetractor\u201d) because he or she gave a score of 2, but it\u2019s even more useful to know why.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/average-net-promoter-score-by-industry-survey.jpg\" alt=\"average net promoter score survey question\" class=\"wp-image-22547\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is why we strongly recommend adding a follow-up question to&nbsp;your&nbsp;NPS one, asking the respondent to&nbsp;explain their score.&nbsp;This is now a very common and highly recommended practice.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can identify disfunctions by&nbsp;surveying your customers (and particularly your unhappy customers). You can then identify priority areas for improvement and build an action plan to increase&nbsp;your&nbsp;overall NPS score.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-analyse-your-overall-nps-score-in-detail\">2 \u2013&nbsp;Analyse your Overall NPS Score in Detail&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have 30% promoters and 40% detractors, your&nbsp;will have an&nbsp;NPS&nbsp;of&nbsp;-10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have 10% promoters and 20% detractors, you will have an NPS of -10.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, customer satisfaction is clearly different in&nbsp;both&nbsp;cases.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/average-net-promoter-score.jpg\" alt=\"NPS\" class=\"wp-image-22548\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To correctly interpret your NPS score, you need to do a more in-depth analysis: analyse your customer breakdown in these three categories: promoters, detractors, neutrals. You should monitor your customer breakdown in each category on your dashboards, just like&nbsp;your&nbsp;overall NPS score.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-don-t-neglect-your-neutral-customers\">3 \u2013&nbsp;Don\u2019t Neglect your \u201cNeutral\u201d Customers&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers who answer your NPS question with a 7 or 8 belong to the so-called \u201cneutral\u201d category. These customers are also sometimes referred to as \u201cpassive\u201d. The percentage of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mycustomer.com\/customer-experience\/engagement\/why-neutral-customer-emotions-are-so-important-to-contact-centre\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">neutral customers<\/a>&nbsp;is not taken into account when calculating an NPS score. Yet there are lots of reasons to target this category of customers with specific marketing actions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is a good&nbsp;NPS&nbsp;score?
