Thanks to this survey, you can discover your product\u2019s strengths and where it could be improved. The USE survey is a tool used in the ongoing improvement process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The USE survey is one of the reference surveys used in evaluating user experience. But it\u2019s not the only one. To discover other survey models, check out our summary of UX surveys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">The USE Survey Structure \u2013 4 Sections, 30 Questions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The USE survey is made up of 30 questions organized into 4 sections:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Usefulness<\/strong>: 8 questions to measure the usefulness of your digital product.<\/li><li><strong>Ease of Use<\/strong>: 10 questions to measure ease of use.<\/li><li><strong>Ease of Learning<\/strong>: 4 questions to measure the speed of your users\u2019 learning curve.<\/li><li><strong>Satisfaction<\/strong>: 7 questions to measure your user\u2019s satisfaction.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, the USE survey allows you to cover all aspects of a product or digital service\u2019s usability. This leads to a very interesting UX survey. It can be distributed to beta testers before the commercialization of the product and throughout the user\u2019s life cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The questions are created as statements written in the first person. For each statement, the respondent must indicate how far they agree with the statement. The USE survey uses a 7 level Likert scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The respondent that chooses \u201c1\u201d completely disagrees with the statement.<\/li><li>The respondent that chooses \u201c7\u201d completely agrees with the statement.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s find out which questions make up the USE survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\">8 Questions to Measure the Usefulness of Your Digital Product<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Is your digital product useful for your users? Does it allow your users to address their challenges, needs and goals?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>User experience must first be thought about through the prism of usefulness. It\u2019s for this reason that USE survey creators chose to start with a series of question-statements centered around the usefulness of your product or digital service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the list of question-statements:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>This helps me be more efficient.<\/li><li>This helps me be more productive.<\/li><li>This product is useful to me.<\/li><li>This product gives me more control over my activities.<\/li><li>This product makes it easier to complete my tasks.<\/li><li>This product saves me time.<\/li><li>This product meets my requirements.<\/li><li>This product did everything I expected it to do.<\/li><li>This helps me be more efficient.<\/li><li>This helps me be more productive.<\/li><li>This product is useful to me.<\/li><li>This product gives me more control over my activities.<\/li><li>This product makes it easier to complete my tasks.<\/li><li>This product saves me time.<\/li><li>This product meets my requirements.<\/li><li>This product did everything I expected it to do.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-use-ux-survey.jpg\" alt=\"survey question\" class=\"wp-image-22577\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The structure of the statements can, of course, be personalized. You can replace \u201cthis\u201d and \u201cthe product\u201d with the name of your product or the type of product you are offering. For example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Skeepers CX Management helps me be more efficient.<\/li><li>The software helps me be more efficient.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the introduction of these 8 questions, we\u2019ve voluntarily varied the way in which we word the statements. However, to stay consistent, we would recommend you find one structure that you stick to throughout the survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\">10 Questions to Measure Ease of Use<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first group of question-statements that we\u2019ve reviewed allow you to evaluate how much a product can answer the needs and expectations of your users and customers. In the second section, you no longer need to evaluate the capacity of the software, but the simplicity of its use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very important aspect of UX. A software that can do this and that is essential, but it\u2019s a must that you can do it easily, without difficulty and\/or technical expertise. This is a frequent mistake we find in UX: thinking about aesthetics before practicality. The aim of UX is not to produce a beautiful interface, but to produce an ergonomic interface that will guide users through their activities and in reaching their goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The USE survey puts forward 10 question-statements to evaluate the ergonomics of your digital service. Comments concerning the wording of questions are equally valuable here and, for that matter, throughout the entire survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the 10 statements that make up this section:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It\u2019s easy to use.<\/li><li>It\u2019s simple to use.<\/li><li>It\u2019s user-friendly.<\/li><li>The number of steps needed to achieve what I want to do has been reduced to a minimum.<\/li><li>It\u2019s flexible.<\/li><li>Its use doesn\u2019t require any effort.<\/li><li>I don\u2019t need to read the instructions to use it.<\/li><li>I didn\u2019t encounter any inconsistencies while using it.<\/li><li>The product is as useful for casual users as it is for regular users.<\/li><li>I can correct mistakes quickly and easily.<\/li><li>I can use it successfully every time.<\/li><li>It\u2019s easy to use.<\/li><li>It\u2019s simple to use.<\/li><li>It\u2019s user-friendly.<\/li><li>The number of steps needed to achieve what I want to do has been reduced to a minimum.<\/li><li>It\u2019s flexible.<\/li><li>Its use doesn\u2019t require any effort.<\/li><li>I don\u2019t need to read the instructions to use it.<\/li><li>I didn\u2019t encounter any inconsistencies while using it.<\/li><li>The product is as useful for casual users as it is for regular users.<\/li><li>I can correct mistakes quickly and easily.<\/li><li>I can use it successfully every time.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap5\">4 Questions to Measure the Learning Curve<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ease of learning is another interesting aspect to measure. An entire section of the USE survey is dedicated to this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are 4 suggested statements:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I learned how to use the product quickly.<\/li><li>I easily memorized the function of the product.<\/li><li>It\u2019s easy to learn how to use the product.<\/li><li>I quickly mastered the software.<\/li><li>I learned how to use the product quickly.<\/li><li>I easily memorized the function of the product.<\/li><li>It\u2019s easy to learn how to use the product.<\/li><li>I quickly mastered the software.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap6\">7 Questions to Measure User Satisfaction<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this last block of statements, you need&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/aircall.io\/blog\/customer-happiness\/how-to-measure-customer-satisfaction\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to measure your user satisfaction<\/a>. Here we\u2019re interested in the user\u2019s general judgement of the product and how they feel about it. This closing section of the USE survey is, therefore, set apart from the previous sections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first three sections analyze the most objective aspects. Whether a user manages to easily use the software or struggles to understand how it works are objective facts and are not subjective feelings. On the contrary, when we ask users whether they are satisfied with the product, we look to their subjective opinion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s completely logical that the \u201csatisfaction\u201d section comes last since these elements are evaluated in the first three sections, which form and explain the user\u2019s subjective feelings. A product that\u2019s useful, easy to use and with a quick learning curve leads to the user feeling satisfied.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final section is dedicated to user satisfaction and comprises these 7 statements:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I\u2019m satisfied with the product.<\/li><li>I\u2019m going to recommend the product to a friend.<\/li><li>It\u2019s fun to use.<\/li><li>The product works like I want it to work.<\/li><li>It\u2019s a wonderful product.<\/li><li>I think I need this product.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s pleasant to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/why-and-how-use-ux-survey-nps.jpg\" alt=\"NPS USE survey\" class=\"wp-image-22579\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap7\">Evaluating the Positive and Negative Aspects of the Product<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The USE survey is original: after the four thematic sections, the respondent is invited to list the main negative and positive aspects of the product without a response scale. There are no predetermined answers either. If the respondent wants to, they are invited to share their opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of the product. They can give up to 3 negative points and 3 positive points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"to-conclude-it-s-worth-noting-that-the-use-survey-is-used-by-thousands-of-businesses-across-the-world-and-has-a-proven-track-record-but-it-s-not-the-only-available-ux-survey-to-discover-more-information-about-surveys-we-recommend-that-you-read-our-skeepers-articles\">To conclude, it\u2019s worth noting that the USE survey is used by thousands of businesses across the world and has a proven track record.
