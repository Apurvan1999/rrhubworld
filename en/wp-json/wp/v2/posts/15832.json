The Likert scale is <strong>one of the most frequently used rating scales<\/strong> in studies and satisfaction surveys.<br \/>\nThis being said, how can you use this rating scale effectively in your own surveys?<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Likert scale?<\/h2>\n<h3>Definition of the Likert scale<\/h3>\n<p>The Likert scale\u00a0is <strong>a rating scale<\/strong> that usually includes <strong>between 3 and 7 answer options<\/strong>, and is <strong>very frequently <\/strong>used in studies and surveys. This rating scale can help you determine to what extent participants agree or disagree with a statement. The Likert scale was developed by Rensis Likert, an American psychologist, at the beginning of the 1930s.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example:<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 603px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/example-likert-scale.jpg\" alt=\"example-likert-scale\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Of course, the terminology used for each of these options may vary. For example, \u201cno opinion\u201d could be replaced by \u201cneither agree nor disagree\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d.<\/p>\n<h3>Using the Likert scale in marketing<\/h3>\n<p>While this rating scale was originally designed to <strong>elicit the opinions of participants<\/strong>, nowadays it is often used in marketing to <strong>evaluate customer satisfaction,<\/strong> for <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/csat-works-customer-experience-high-priority-metric\/\">the Customer Satisfaction Score, or CSAT.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow satisfied are you with [Product X, Service Y, etc]?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very unsatisfied<\/li>\n<li>Unsatisfied<\/li>\n<li>Neutral<\/li>\n<li>Satisfied<\/li>\n<li>Very satisfied<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 607px; height: 669px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/likert-scale-customer-satisfaction-survey.jpg\" alt=\"likert-scale-customer-satisfaction-survey\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This<strong> simple tool<\/strong>, with its wide variety of possible answer options, can enable you to obtain <strong>very accurate feedback<\/strong>. This is the key reason for its success.<\/p>\n<p>The Likert scale has also been the inspiration for most other types of rating scales. For example, numeric rating scales are closely based on Likert scales.<\/p>\n<h2>Our suggestions for using the Likert scale effectively<\/h2>\n<h3>How many answer options should you include in your Likert scale?<\/h3>\n<p>We recommend using an<strong> odd number of answer options<\/strong>, either 3, 5 or 7, in order to give participants the option to state a neutral opinion.<\/p>\n<p>Answer scales with even numbers will \u201cpush\u201d participants to make a choice. While this may make data analysis easier by creating more clear-cut results, it could also end up skewing the results, if participants had a neutral opinion on the subject but could not select a \u201cneutral\u201d answer option.<\/p>\n<p>It is possible to\u00a0add additional options to the scale\u00a0in order to obtain more precise and nuanced feedback. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not at all satisfied<\/li>\n<li>Unsatisfied<\/li>\n<li>Somewhat unsatisfied<\/li>\n<li>Neutral<\/li>\n<li>Somewhat satisfied<\/li>\n<li>Satisfied<\/li>\n<li>Very satisfied<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>However, we suggest\u00a0<strong>not including too many answer options<\/strong>\u00a0in your rating scales. It might seem like the more options you offer, the more precise the feedback will be.<\/p>\n<p>This is true to a certain point, but having more t<strong>han 7 options will create the opposite effect<\/strong>. Studies have shown that when a scale has more than 7 options, some participants will answer randomly, as they have difficulty selecting an option that matches their opinion. In most cases,\u00a0<strong>we recommend including 5 options<\/strong>\u00a0in your Likert scale.<\/p>\n<h3>Should your Likert scale be symmetrical or asymmetrical?<\/h3>\n<p>It is not essential for your answer options to be symmetrical. <strong>Asymmetrical rating scales<\/strong> can sometimes be <strong>easier to understand.<\/strong> Take a look at these two examples:<\/p>\n<p>Example\u00a0A:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very good<\/li>\n<li>Good<\/li>\n<li>No opinion<\/li>\n<li>Bad<\/li>\n<li>Very bad<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Example B:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Excellent<\/li>\n<li>Good<\/li>\n<li>No opinion<\/li>\n<li>Bad<\/li>\n<li>Terrible<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 625px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/asymmetrical-likert-scale.jpg\" alt=\"asymmetrical-likert-scale\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The scale used in example A is perfectly symmetrical. The scale in example B is asymmetrical. <strong>Asymmetrical rating scales<\/strong> can sometimes sound <strong>clearer and more natural<\/strong> to the participant. Once again, it is not absolutely necessary to have perfect symmetry in the wording of your answer options.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Discover <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/maximize-survey-response-rates-perfect-wording\/\">How to maximize your response rate with perfect wording<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>How can you create an effective numbered Likert scale?<\/h3>\n<p>Numbered rating scales can sometimes result in confusion for participants. While it is not necessary to avoid using them, if you choose to use a numbered Likert scale in your survey, <strong>make sure that your participants can easily understand what each number represents<\/strong>. If necessary, include a legend in your survey.<\/p>\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n<p>1 = Very satisfied<br \/>\n5 = Not at all satisfied<\/p>\n<p>You can also use smileys, like in this example:<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 334px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/likert-scale-example-smiley-legend.jpg\" alt=\"likert-scale-example-smiley-legend\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Your Likert scale should include the entire spectrum of opinions<\/h3>\n<p>It is very important to include options corresponding to the entire spectrum of possible opinions in your Likert scale. For example, <strong>avoid questions<\/strong> that look like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very satisfied<\/li>\n<li>Satisfied<\/li>\n<li>Somewhat satisfied<\/li>\n<li>Neutral<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In this example, the entire range of possible opinions is clearly not represented. To obtain accurate results, your Likert scale must be \u201cinclusive\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The Likert scale is used in nearly all surveys, and plays a particularly significant role in customer satisfaction surveys. Seen in many different forms, this rating scale is known for it\u2019s ability to elicit accurate and easy-to-analyze feedback.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Key points to remember:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>-Offer a<strong>n odd number of answer options<\/strong>, including a neutral option<br \/>\n-It is not essential to have symmetrical answer options, what\u2019s important is to\u00a0<strong>make sure they are written clearly<\/strong><br \/>\n-If you use a\u00a0<strong>numbered scale<\/strong>, make sure it is\u00a0<strong>easy\u00a0<\/strong>for participants\u00a0<strong>to understand<\/strong><br \/>\n-We recommend\u00a0<strong>5 answer options<\/strong>, or a maximum of 7<br \/>\n-Be sure to\u00a0<strong>include answer options<\/strong>\u00a0that correspond to the\u00a0<strong>entire range of possible opinions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u200b<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101.png\" alt=\"Download your customer knowledge program\" \/><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101', {}); \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Though you may have never heard of the Likert scale, you\u2019ve almost certainly seen it before.
