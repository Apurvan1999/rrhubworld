Many brands partner with influencers to increase brand awareness, drive engagement, and boost conversions. To understand what strategies to use for your campaigns, you need to understand the metrics that will most clearly and accurately reflect your goals.<\/p>\n<p>When brands are looking at potential partners, they focus heavily on the number of followers the influencer has. The potential reach an influencer has is definitely important when you\u2019re creating a campaign, but it\u2019s not the only metric to consider. Understanding both unique reach and frequency will give you a good idea about what metrics you can expect to see from a campaign, and help inform what types of content will make the biggest impact on your audience.<\/p>\n<p>What is reach?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.octoly.com\/what-to-know-about-reach-and-impressions-for-your-next-influencer-campaign\/\">Reach<\/a> refers to the audience, followers, or customer base you\u2019re trying to target with a campaign. It\u2019s the number of people who could potentially see your content or ads. Reach breaks down into potential reach and actual reach.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Potential reach<\/strong> is the total number of followers that you (or your influencers) have. It\u2019s the people who have actually subscribed to your content or social media profile. <br \/><strong>Actual reach<\/strong> is the number of unique accounts that have actually viewed your content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When working with an influencer, it\u2019s important to keep their potential reach in mind, so you have a baseline for your KPIs. As your reach increases, so will brand awareness. But, you need to remember that reach and engagement are not equal. If 10,000 people see your post but aren\u2019t interested in your brand, your content is driving conversions or engagement.<\/p>\n<p>What are impressions?<\/p>\n<p>Impressions are the number of times your post or content is displayed to your followers. This just means that the content was delivered to someone\u2019s feed \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean that they actually saw it or clicked on it. One person can also have more than one impression for the same piece of content. If a post shows up in someone\u2019s from the original sharer and is then reshared onto their feed by a friend, there would be two impressions tracked for one post.<\/p>\n<p>If you see growth in the number of impressions, that means your content is appearing more frequently on users\u2019 feeds. It\u2019s a good indicator of whether your posts are optimized for the social platform. If you\u2019re seeing lower impressions than you expect, make sure the content you and your influencers are sharing is tailored to that platform. Like reach, impressions aren\u2019t necessarily equal to engagement. So relying on impressions alone as an indicator of success isn\u2019t always the most accurate way to see the impact of your campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s unique reach?<\/p>\n<p>Unlike impressions, which are counted multiple times for the same post, unique reach measures the total number of unique people who see an ad or post. Unique reach is so important because it shows you how many people saw your content across different apps, sites, devices, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Since impressions track every single time your content is viewed, unique reach will indicate that a single user saw your content three different times. Why does this matter? Because unique reach means more widespread brand awareness to new faces. But, you can\u2019t measure campaign success based on unique reach alone. The two metrics included in measuring unique reach are the number of unique users and the average impression frequency per user.<\/p>\n<p>Why you should also focus on frequency<\/p>\n<p>Impressions will always be higher than reach because each time a user sees an ad or piece of content, it\u2019s counted as an impression. If you\u2019re trying to expand your audience and increase brand awareness, you can\u2019t expect every person who sees your content to immediately convert. That\u2019s where frequency comes in.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>People typically need to see or hear about something <a href=\"https:\/\/siglcreative.com\/2019\/06\/07\/rule-of-7\/\">seven times<\/a> before they make a purchasing decision. You want to reach customers multiple times so they become more comfortable with your brands and products. Frequency helps increase familiarity, which leads to conversions from new customers.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There is balance when it comes to working with influencers for your campaigns. Working with new influencers can help spread brand awareness and introduce your product and message to a wider audience, however, it\u2019s important to reactivate influencers from your past collaborations to maximize on the conversion benefits of frequency.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re tracking the performance of influencer marketing campaigns, you should focus on frequency instead of (or in addition to) unique reach. Frequency shows you how many times a user needs to see a post before they make a purchasing decision. It also helps you avoid ad fatigue by tracking the average conversion rate based on frequency.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Frequency will shift from campaign to campaign and from brand to brand. If you\u2019re running a time-sensitive promotion campaign, you\u2019ll want a higher frequency count over a short amount of time. If your goal is to increase brand exposure over time, you can share content on a more consistent frequency to build reach without overwhelming your followers.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re getting ready to run an influencer marketing campaign, you want to make sure you\u2019re tracking the right metrics so you can see how your campaign is performing. Knowing which metrics to track depends on your campaign goals, but they\u2019re not interchangeable. Learning the difference between reach, impressions, and frequency will give you a better understanding of how your campaigns are doing and if your tactics are effective. Focusing on frequency instead of unique reach will give you better insight into conversions and purchasing decisions of your target audience.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Request a Demo<\/h2>\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_6  et_pb_text_align_justified et_pb_bg_layout_light\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>Octoly makes it easy for brands to build authentic text reviews and amazing influencer content with product seeding campaigns at scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Related Articles<\/h2>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Understanding how many people will potentially see your content is a key consideration when partnering with influencers and building influencer marketing campaigns.
