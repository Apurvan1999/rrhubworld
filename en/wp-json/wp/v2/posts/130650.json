To do this, nothing could be easier! All you have to do is create an account, different from the brand, on the social networks on which you operate. Then, follow your brand as well as accounts evolving in the same universe or of influencers who carry the same values or commitments. You can also follow inspiring accounts in terms of design.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you are a food brand operating on Instagram, then follow your brand as well as chefs and food influencers who will share content that will inspire you. Also, <strong>pay attention to the hashtags<\/strong> they use! This is a great tool that is present on the majority of platforms that allow you to gather a whole niche community.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" data-service=\"tiktok\" data-script-embed=\"true\" data-responsive=\"true\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto; max-height: 36px;\">\n<div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@omnivorousadam\/video\/7043063429443095814\" data-video-id=\"7043063429443095814\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\">\n<section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@omnivorousadam\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@omnivorousadam\" rel=\"noopener\">@omnivorousadam<\/a> Who would win in a fight a very angry @Jamie Oliver or a chilled out @Gordon Ramsay? <a title=\"shepherdspie\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/shepherdspie\" rel=\"noopener\">#shepherdspie<\/a> <a title=\"comfortfood\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/comfortfood\" rel=\"noopener\">#comfortfood<\/a> <a title=\"unitedkingdom\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/unitedkingdom\" rel=\"noopener\">#unitedkingdom<\/a> <a title=\"cookingtips\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/cookingtips\" rel=\"noopener\">#cookingtips<\/a> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\u266c original sound - Omnivorous Adam\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/music\/original-sound-7043063406026328837\" rel=\"noopener\">\u266c original sound &#8211; Omnivorous Adam<\/a> <\/section>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p> <script async=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/embed.js\"><\/script><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Brainstorm with your influencer ambassadors<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Content creators are constantly using social networks, so they are the most likely to offer you content that is up to date and that will appeal to their community!

For example, you can <strong>suggest that they set up a poll via a sticker link<\/strong> in an Instagram story, so that they ask their followers what kind of content they would like to see.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Follow content provided by social networking and influencer marketing experts<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">A <strong>newsletter<\/strong>, whether weekly or monthly, is an excellent way of keeping up to date with the latest trends.
