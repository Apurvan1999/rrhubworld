Put simply, UGC or <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/ugc-and-influencer-marketing-how-will-they-complement-each-other-in-2022\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">user-generated content<\/a> is what we call any content created by users and featuring a brand. Customer reviews are UGC. A user sharing photos of their hotel room on Instagram is creating UGC. A web user who posts a video on social media to show off their latest pair of sneakers is producing UGC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this comprehensive guide, we\u2019re going to look at&nbsp;<strong>why brands should be including UGC in their marketing<\/strong>&nbsp;strategy. We\u2019re going to outline the&nbsp;<strong>main types of user-generated content<\/strong>&nbsp;and give you some&nbsp;<strong>examples of UGC<\/strong>. Then we\u2019re going to give you a few tips and best practices for how to get the most out of UGC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ugc-or-user-generated-content-what-is-it-exactly-definition\"><strong>UGC or user-generated content: what is it exactly? [Definition]<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"chap1\"><strong>UGC<\/strong>&nbsp;is the acronym for \u201c<strong>User-Generated Content<\/strong>\u201d. Once we\u2019ve unpacked the term for you, you\u2019ll be an expert! UGC is simply the content your users or customers produce featuring your brand or products. You\u2019ll see later on that this content can take different forms, some of them pretty standard and others more original.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>reviews customers leave on a website\u2019s product pages<\/strong>&nbsp;are a typical example of traditional UGC. User-generated video is a more elaborate and original format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>UGC refers to content created by users, but also content produced by customers or web users. So, as you can see, the word \u201cuser\u201d in \u201cuser-generated\u201d should be understood in the broad sense. Some use the term&nbsp;<strong>CGC or Customer-Generated Content<\/strong>&nbsp;to describe content created by \u201ccustomers\u201d. But adding a new term into the mix might just be complicating things unnecessarily. At Teester, we use an inclusive definition of users.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By now you will have understood that&nbsp;<strong>UGC is different from the content created and shared by brands<\/strong>, i.e. \u201cbrand content\u201d, meaning all the content produced by marketing teams, web copywriters, advertisers, community managers, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\"><strong>6 reasons to use UGC in your marketing strategy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-gain-more-credibility\">1 &#8211; <strong>Gain more credibility<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>UGC is powerful because it is authentic.<\/strong>&nbsp;Users aren\u2019t paid or commissioned by brands to create this content. They produce authentic reviews to help guide other users in their choices, and they do this in all sectors (fashion, travel, automotive, insurance, restaurants, etc.).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web users, and Millennials, in particular, are becoming more and more immune to traditional marketing methods and are increasingly suspicious of sponsored content. They want authenticity and reviews from real customers. A Nielson study relayed by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartinsights.com\/content-management\/content-marketing-strategy\/5-ways-use-user-generated-content-in-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Smart Insights<\/a>&nbsp;showed that&nbsp;<strong>92% of customers trust user-generated content more than they trust traditional advertising<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/3C0B3AC4-110C-427D-9D78-A5D85C25807D.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-268\" title=\"nike-user-generated-content\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of&nbsp;<strong>giving you more credibility with your community<\/strong>, using UGC in your marketing strategy earns you major brownie points with Google. Google\u2019s web crawlers consider that user-generated content builds trust and that improves your ranking on the search engine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-increase-your-engagement-rate\"><strong>2 &#8211; Increase your engagement rate<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>User-generated content increases your engagement rate. Most of your customers are&nbsp;<strong>nano-influencers<\/strong>&nbsp;and this makes them precious allies. They\u2019re your main&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/build-relationship-of-trust\/\"><strong>ambassadors<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/a>and your best bet for viral and authentic marketing. That\u2019s because web users engage with each other much more than they do with brands.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The content they produce and share on social media receives proportionally more engagement from their peers and is considered reliable and trustworthy. <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/user-generated-content-rules-to-engage-your-communities\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Asking your community to create UGC <\/a>is also a great way to get lots of photos, videos, articles featuring your products. This in turn will get you a heap of authentic customer reviews and increase your&nbsp;<strong>e-reputation<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-increase-your-visibility\"><strong>3 &#8211; Increase your visibility<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When web users create content or contribute to its creation, they love to share it with their community on social media. The posts will reach not only your own brand community but also other users (a pool of potential prospects) that follow your customers on social media, i.e. their friends, family, colleagues, etc. This&nbsp;<strong>significantly increases your audience<\/strong>, giving you more visibility and allowing you to build up your reputation on the web and attract traffic to your site, with one major added advantage: consumers are much more likely to trust content shared by other consumers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-reduce-your-marketing-costs\">4 &#8211; <strong>Reduce your marketing costs<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>User-generated content saves you money on marketing costs.<\/strong>&nbsp;The reason is simple: it\u2019s your users, customers, and web users who are creating your brand\u2019s content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike&nbsp;<strong>paid media<\/strong>, where brands leverage third-party channels to market themselves (press ad space, TV spots, email campaigns, billboards, Google AdWords, radio ads, etc.), word-of-mouth, comments, blog articles, forum posts, user-generated video reviews, positive press coverage, and all other forms of UGC are \u201c<strong>earned media<\/strong>\u201d for companies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In times of economic crisis when marketing budgets tend to be tight, using UGC is the ideal solution. UGC is a cheaper way to increase your brand\u2019s visibility. That doesn\u2019t mean that UGC will replace brand content! The two work hand in hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-get-to-know-your-users-and-customers\">5 &#8211; <strong>Get to know your users and customers<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Content that is created and shared by users, in the form of customer reviews, Instagram posts or blog comments, for example, allows you to really get to know your users and customers, their expectations and wants, their needs, and how they feel about your products and services. Encouraging UGC creation is a way to develop what\u2019s known as the \u201c<strong>Voice of the Customer<\/strong>\u201d, or VoC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-become-more-user-and-customer-centric\">6 &#8211; <strong>Become more user- and customer-centric<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By valuing and showcasing UGC, by encouraging your users to share their reviews and their experience with your brand, you\u2019re making them your focus. You\u2019re involving them in your brand\u2019s adventure and fostering&nbsp;<strong>the creation of a real community<\/strong>. Encouraging your users to produce UGC sends them the message: \u201cYour voice counts! Express yourself!\u201d &nbsp;Using UGC is an essential lever for becoming user-centric and having your users actively participate in your brand\u2019s development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\"><strong>A look at 6 types of user-generated content<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are as many types of UGC as there are forms of content that can be published and shared by your users. Here are the main types of user-generated content:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-customer-reviews\">1 &#8211; <strong>Customer reviews<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer reviews are the most widespread and likely the oldest form of user-generated content. This type of UGC is usually found on the product pages of e-commerce sites.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-comments-on-articles-and-forums\">2 &#8211; <strong>Comments on articles and forums<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The comments section under articles posted on a brand\u2019s blog enables users and customers to interact with the content. Some brands host their own forums, so their users can communicate with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-messages-posted-on-social-media\">3 &#8211; <strong>Messages posted on social media<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media are the ultimate channel for sharing UGC. When a customer posts content about your brand on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, they\u2019re creating UGC\u2026 and they might not even know it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-photo-sharing\">4 &#8211; <strong>Photo sharing&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A picture is worth a thousand words! Nowhere is this truer than on social media. Photos are the&nbsp;<strong>lifeblood of social networks like Instagram and Pinterest<\/strong>. In posts and stories posted to social media, the message is often better conveyed through pictures than text.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Capture-de\u0301cran-2021-06-10-a\u0300-15.30.22-1024x571-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-269\" title=\"Capture d\u2019\u00e9cran 2021-06-10 \u00e0 15.30.22\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-user-generated-video\">5 &#8211; <strong>User-generated video<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Video is the favorite medium of web users looking for reviews from other consumers. User-generated video has really been taking off over the last few years. It allows consumers to get an accurate idea of the product or service the company is selling, through the experience of another consumer sharing precious and relevant advice. Overall, video is now gaining more and more ground in marketing.\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/solution-user-generated-video-en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">User-generated videos<\/a> are the ultimate UGC.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"some-examples-of-ugc-in-marketing\"><strong>Some examples of UGC in marketing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-lacoste\"><strong>1 \u2013 Lacoste<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"chap4\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lacoste.com\/us\/sale\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lacoste.com<\/a>&nbsp;knows that customer reviews are a must-have for any e-commerce site.

This is a very common practice these days; most e-commerce sites have a dedicated area for reviews on their product pages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Image-3-lacoste-integration-ordinateur-1024x556-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-270\" title=\"Image 3 lacoste int\u00e9gration ordinateur\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-tripadvisor\"><strong>2 \u2013 TripAdvisor<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>UGC is what&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/tripadvisor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tripadvisor<\/a>&nbsp;is all about.

Inauthentic UGC that looks and feels like promotional content will fall flat!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-have-a-good-mix-of-visual-formats\"><strong>2 \u2013 Have a good mix of visual formats&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Text is no longer enough these days. Consumers need to see and get a feel for a product before buying. For this, nothing beats user-generated videos and photos by your communities! These types of content are not only the most reassuring during the buying process, they are also the most engaging and get the most shares on social media!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-make-your-content-shareable-and-memorable\"><strong>3 \u2013 Make your content shareable and memorable<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Web users are exposed to so much different content in a day. You need to stand out. This is true for both brand content and user-generated content. If you plan on launching a UGC campaign, keep this in mind: UGC has to grab attention and, if you want to go viral, it has to be easily shareable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-measure-the-impact-of-each-bit-of-content\"><strong>4 \u2013 Measure the impact of each bit of content&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To improve the performance of your UGC, the first step is to analyze it.
