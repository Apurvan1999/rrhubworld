It enables you to feed exclusive data into your CRM solution, thus enriching your customer knowledge and improving your campaign ROI.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give you a preview of some of the possibilities offered by this integration, we will present 6 practical use cases. If you\u2019re a Splio client, this article was written for you and will convince you to take things to the next level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\">The Splio &amp; SKEEPERS CX Management &#8211; Improving your Marketing Performance<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CX Management is a software that <strong>measures customer experience<\/strong> and enriches customer knowledge through smart surveys. It aims to improve your CRM and Marketing solutions. With this in mind, we have developed a Splio native connector.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CX Managementk + Splio integration enables you to use CX Management surveys to enrich Splio with exclusive customer data and to improve the ROI of your loyalty marketing campaigns in 3 steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Trigger <strong>instant smart suveys<\/strong> on your various customer journey channels.<\/li><li><strong>Enrich Splio<\/strong> with the survey responses. Use the exclusive data collected via the surveys to enrich your customer files and segments.<\/li><li>Trigger ultra-targeted marketing campaigns or actions using CX Management data.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/enrich-splio-database-increase.jpg\" alt=\"Splio integration\" class=\"wp-image-18977\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you know the general idea, let\u2019s take a look at 6 use cases that reflect the main benefits of integrating these two solutions. But first, here\u2019s a quick reminder of how to design a CX Management survey.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">Designing Efficient Surveys to Enrich Splio<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can enrich your Splio CRM with exclusive customer data, using <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/cx-management-en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CX Management<\/a> surveys. Providing, of course, that you design efficient surveys. The CX Management solution offers all the features you need to do this. Here are the 4 steps to follow:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Step 1 (Why?)<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Start by identifying the data you would like to collect from your customers.<\/li><li><strong>Step 2 (When?)<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Decide at which stage of the customer journey you want to deploy your surveys and collect targeted data. For example: following an in-store purchase, following an online purchase, etc.<\/li><li><strong>Step 3 (What?)<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Define your survey content and which performance indicators you want to use (Net Promoter Score, Customer Satisfaction Score, etc.). The design of your survey and the way you phrase your questions depends on your data needs (the target data identified in step 1).<\/li><li><strong>Step 4 (Where?)<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Deploy your survey on the appropriate channel; your website after an order has been placed, by email via Splio following an in-store purchase, etc.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\">6 Use Cases to Maximise Splio &amp; CX Management Integration Benefits<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Without further ado, let\u2019s take a look at the 6 use cases mentioned above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use Case 1 \u2013 Enriching Splio Customer Files&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CX Management surveys <strong>measure your customer satisfaction<\/strong> and also provide an opportunity to get to know your them better, to develop your customer knowledge by collecting information:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Profile data: Birthdays, telephone numbers, etc.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Buying habits: favourite products, preferred buying modes, preferred delivery modes, etc.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/enrich-splio-increase-turnover.jpg\" alt=\"Splio customer files\" class=\"wp-image-18980\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use CX Management surveys to collect any information you are missing about your contacts or customers. This information is then automatically integrated, in real time, into your Splio customer files via the native connector, according to your customised matching rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CX Management top tip: Ask your &#8220;customer knowledge\u201d questions at the end of your survey, with a separate \u201cGetting to know you\u201d page, for example. With CX Management, you can display these questions in a dynamic manner: the question is only asked if the associated field in your Splio customer file is empty. You can therefore avoid asking customers for information you already have! This is a valuable feature that will improve your survey experience and increase your response rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Use 2 \u2013 Adding Contacts to your Splio Segments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use CX Management surveys to increase your subscriber lists. How? Trigger a capture survey in the form of a \u201cSubscribe\u201d button for unidentified visitors who spend more than 5 minutes on your website. Surveys can serve more than one purpose and can also be used as registration forms!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/splio-database-increase-turnover.jpg\" alt=\"Adding Contacts\" class=\"wp-image-18982\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use surveys to collect opt-in information from identified visitors on your website if you are missing this data. CX Management surveys can become an integral part of your GDPR compliance approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use Case 3 \u2013 Using your Marketing Personas<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Survey answers can be used to determine <a href=\"\/en\/blog\/use-personas-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a marketing persona<\/a>. This is a particularly interesting survey use case, in which questions are used to qualify a respondent\u2019s profile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marketing personas are a powerful tool for segmenting and targeting your marketing actions. Once the data relating to the persona has been added to your Splio customer files, you can automatically trigger targeted actions, according to that persona. For example, you can send a specific category of personas information about a loyalty programme, special offers or private sales.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/enrich-splio-database-turnover.jpg\" alt=\"Marketing Personas\" class=\"wp-image-18979\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use Case 4 \u2013 Using Engagement Scoring<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This use case is closely related to the last one. It consists in using survey answers to <strong>calculate an engagement score<\/strong>. Which questions? Which answers? That\u2019s up to you! For example, you can combine an NPS satisfaction score with buying intent to evaluate and score your customer engagement. NPS promoters with strong buying intent will have the highest score. These scores will help you dynamically generate segments that you can then use directly in Splio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/enrich-splio-database.jpg\" alt=\"Splio NPS Score\" class=\"wp-image-18976\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use Case 5 \u2013 Reducing Shopping Cart Abandonment<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A user discovers your website, visits it, adds a product to their basket\u2026 and then suddenly moves to exit the page. But all is not lost! You can try to retain them by triggering a CX Management survey in the form of a pop-up at the exact moment they express exit intent (movement of mouse, etc.).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This survey serves two objectives:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Identifying the purchasing barrier(s)<\/strong>.&nbsp;Why did the customer not go through with their order? There are several possible answers: payment security, login problems, return policies, product availability, etc. These answers will help you identify the main purchasing barriers on your online journeys.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Reassuring customers to eliminate the barrier(s)<\/strong>. Once the survey has been completed, you can redirect the customer to an online content page, providing reassurance about the most common barriers (FAQ for example).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/splio-database-increase.jpg\" alt=\"Splio shopping cart\" class=\"wp-image-18981\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These survey answers will feed and enrich your Splio customer files and segments. You can also then trigger a reassurance campaign by email about the main barriers you have identified, that require reassurance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use Case 6 \u2013 Retaining Email Subscribers&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine a contact has subscribed to your relationship programme and receives a marketing email in their inbox. They decide to send a request to unsubscribe. What should you do? You can trigger a survey to identify the reasons they want to unsubscribe: too many emails? Irrelevant content? Unsuitable channel? At the end of the survey, you can offer solutions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Choice of frequency: weekly, monthly, quarterly\u2026<\/li><li>Choice of topics: special offers, newsletter, competitions\u2026<\/li><li>Choice of channel: notifications, SMS, emails\u2026<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/splio-increase-turnover.jpg\" alt=\"email newsletter\" class=\"wp-image-18983\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach will enable you to identify the possible weaknesses in your programmes and marketing campaigns, but also to limit the number of contacts who unsubscribe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These use cases provide a little preview of some of the opportunities presented by the Splio &amp; CX Management integration. And you\u2019ll no doubt discover and imagine lots more. We hope to have convinced you of the benefits of using our connector.
