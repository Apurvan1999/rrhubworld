The average American is exposed to hundreds, if not thousands, of advertisements each day (no one seems to agree on an exact figure, despite the oft-cited 5,000-per-day estimate)<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">. Facing an enormous onslaught of competition from old advertising standbys like television, radio, and print, and newer media like mobile and online, brands must work harder than ever to cut through all the other voices in order to connect with consumers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Word-of-mouth recommendations from friends and family, often referred to as earned advertising, are generally the most influential, with 84% of global respondents in a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nielsen.com\/us\/en\/insights\/report\/2013\/global-trust-in-advertising-and-brand-messages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nielson survey<\/a> citing it as the most trustworthy. But business owners must still make important decisions about the form and content of the marketing they use to drive more customers. The question is how does a business develop a brand\u2019s credibility and awareness while also separating itself from all the rest.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s one suggestion: treat each customer the way you would like to be treated, which is to say like a respected human being. <strong>Consider these three approaches to overcoming generic marketing ploys and injecting a genuine<a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/humanize-customer-journey\/\"> human connection into your customer experience<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s Not All About You<\/h2>\n<p>Have you ever met someone at a party who couldn\u2019t stop talking about himself? Customers feel a little like that when they perceive a company to be indifferent to them, a company whose only interest seems to be itself. Of course, advertising is an opportunity for a brand to sell itself, but today\u2019s audiences <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media-network\/media-network-blog\/2014\/mar\/14\/push-pull-retail-shoppers-tesco\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">won\u2019t necessarily respond to push or \u201cinterruptive\u201d communication<\/a> strategies the way they used to. <strong>Today\u2019s consumer will likely find greater value in a brand that pulls them into a personalized conversation<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Customer service is all about the interaction between the customer and the business. Allowing customers to tell a business what they are doing wrong \u2013 or doing right \u2013 will foster trust, transparency, and loyalty. Successful businesses, like Netflix, need constructive feedback to refine existing services and develop increased customer value. Fortunately, customers are all too <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/how-netflix-rose-from-the-ashes-by-becoming-customer-centric\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">happy to talk with you if they perceive you as a company that actually cares enough to ask for their observations<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Actions Speak Louder than Words<\/h2>\n<p>Go above and beyond. Paying attention to the small details and showing genuine concern for the customer will have a big impact on your company\u2019s customer engagement. Take American retailer, Nordstrom, for example. <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/how-customer-satisfaction-ranks-nordstrom-at-the-top\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nordstrom uses customer service as a competitive advantage<\/a>. In fact, the company is probably better known for its immaculate customer service than the actual merchandise it sells. Company\u2019s employees are known for going the extra mile, treating every customer like a VIP. And that is exactly what customers want. If a customer knows a business cares enough to go the extra mile, they are more likely to deliver high repeat business.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s customers are savvier than ever, easily recognizing hollow platitudes when they hear them. They know that any business can promise \u201c<em>the ultimate customer experience<\/em>\u201d and are intelligent enough to see, via a company\u2019s actions, if those words ring true or not. Fortunately, companies can establish their credibility in any number of ways, for example, <strong>through the use of customer satisfaction surveys which produce feedback that can be acted on in real time<\/strong>. Collect and respond to the feedback, and consider posting on your website the results of your follow up so customers can see you are hard at work on their behalf.<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Always Go With the Safest Option<\/h2>\n<p>Take risks to surprise customers. Innovation is one of the most important factors in determining a business\u2019s success. Amongst all the competition, a business must make sure that the company offers a truly unique or \u2013 at least \u2013 the highest quality product or service in order to survive today\u2019s market place.<\/p>\n<p>Let consumers tell you what they are interested in. Work around their habits and behaviors and design innovative products or services which provide real value to them. Case in point: Starbucks. Starbucks digital efforts like its mobile order, pay, and delivery services <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/customer-loyalty-increases-starbucks-profits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">were designed based on customer feedback<\/a>. Listening to and designing products to simplify transactions has helped build loyalty and boost sales for the coffee chain.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, not coming across as \u201ccorporate\u201d and generic will show customers they are dealing with flesh and blood people. By humanizing customer contact and communication, your business will connect with customers on a far more emotional level, creating both meaningful engagement and increased loyalty.<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--> <a href=\"http:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d.png\" alt=\"Download Ebook How to Learn from your Customers and Get Ahead of your Competitors\" \/><\/a> <\/span> <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n\n        hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d', {});\n    \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span> <!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Customers are bombarded with marketing information.
