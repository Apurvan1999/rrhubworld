This strategy has seduced many brands by its ROI efficiency. It can also meet various objectives:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>visibility,<\/li><li>brand awareness,<\/li><li>engagement,<\/li><li>conversion&#8230;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, by 2022, more than <strong>75% <\/strong>of marketers plan to allocate a budget for influencer marketing (source: <a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Influencer Marketing Hub<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\"><strong>Customer reviews, a purchase factor<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumer reviews feed product and service sheets on various sites, reassure and influence purchasing decisions. Indeed, <strong>90%<\/strong> of consumers read reviews on the brand&#8217;s website or on a dedicated platform before making a purchase (source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.europe-consommateurs.eu\/en\/achats-internet\/les-avis-en-ligne.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Europe Consommateurs<\/a>). On the one hand, with the strong growth of e-commerce, consumers need to know if the product they find on e-shops will suit them. The information written by a consumer under a product about its use, quality, texture will <strong>enlighten their peers but also enhance the product, thus stimulating sales<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, since 2020, consultations of reviews have increased by <strong>45%<\/strong>. Consumer reviews reassure people about their choice of service. A restaurant that has more than 4 out of 5 stars with thousands of reviews will be a <strong>guarantee of quality<\/strong> for consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\"><strong>E-commerce keeps growing<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the consequences of the health crisis has been the explosion of e-commerce. Buying online is part of the daily life of many consumers as a wide variety of products are at their fingertips through e-commerce. Global e-commerce sales are expected to reach <strong>$5 trillion<\/strong> by the end of 2022 (source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/379046\/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Statista<\/a>).

This app created in 2016 has everything to seduce users: originality, video and short content, dynamism&#8230; Moreover, <strong>52%<\/strong> of the internet audience wants brands to be authentic (source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/business\/en\/blog\/small-businesses-winning-promote\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TikTok for Business<\/a>). Thanks to these trends and the light-hearted tone used on the platform, users find this type of content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap5\"><strong>Instagram is still successful<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Instagram reached 2 billion users worldwide in December 2021 (source: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.digimind.com\/fr\/agences\/instagram-chiffres-incontournables-2020-france-et-monde\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Digimind<\/a>). It is the leading social network for influencer marketing and is constantly innovating, especially to compete with its biggest competitor: TikTok. In France, Instagram is the preferred social network of Gen-Z (source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.data.ai\/en\/go\/state-of-mobile-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">App Annie<\/a>). In order to target this generation, so prized by brands, it is strategic to collaborate with nano-influencers and micro-influencers who are real influencers. Thanks to their creation of quality content, on the one hand your products are highlighted to a niche community, on the other hand you collect UGC that you can reuse in other communication media.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Our suggestion:<\/strong> to maintain your relationship with influencers on Instagram, don&#8217;t hesitate to create an ambassador program that will humanise and strengthen your relationship in the long term.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap6\"><strong>YouTube, the massive platform<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the second most used platform in the world after Google, YouTube has a huge global audience. In order to remain attractive, the social network has developed a feature with a video format of less than 60 seconds, inspired by TikTok: <strong>YouTube Shorts<\/strong>. These very short videos achieve <strong>3.5 billion views per day<\/strong> (source: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/tiktok-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hootsuite<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Easy to consume and produce, this feature has a lot going for it. As a brand that collaborates on YouTube through long videos, this is an opportunity for you to vary the type of content and stand out. In 60 seconds, influencers can easily show your products in all their forms as well as its use in the form of a very short tutorial, and thus capture the attention of users.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap7\"><strong>Pinterest: positivity and creativity on display<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The inspiration platform Pinterest has<strong> 431 million monthly active users<\/strong> worldwide (source: <a href=\"https:\/\/business.pinterest.com\/fr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Business Pinterest<\/a>). This platform is a showcase for your products and a creative workshop for influencers. A positive atmosphere, authentic content and aesthetics are all there. In addition, Pinterest develops unique features like <strong>Versions<\/strong> to increase engagement between influencers and their community. By collaborating with influencers on Pinterest, you will meet visibility and conversion goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap8\"><strong>Twitch, the rising livestream platform<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitch, the live streaming platform initially used for e-gaming, now has <strong>17.5 million unique visitors per day<\/strong> worldwide (source: <a href=\"https:\/\/jai-un-pote-dans-la.com\/top-12-des-meilleures-operations-marketing-sur-twitch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">J&#8217;ai Un Pote Dans la Com<\/a>).

Collaborations with influencers on this trendy platform are gradually developing, allowing brands to stand out and reach a large audience.

In 2021, <strong>64% <\/strong>of users have already made a purchase on social networks. This practice is a real success: today, social commerce generates <strong>429 billion dollars<\/strong> and this figure is growing exponentially (source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blogdumoderateur.com\/social-commerce-utilisateurs-achat-reseaux-sociaux-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Accenture<\/a>). Social networks are doing everything possible to develop social commerce thanks to various recommendation features, links to the e-shop, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap10\"><strong>Video: the leading brand content format in 2022<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Video is the format that seduces consumers and brands alike! The creative possibilities are almost infinite: duration, form (TikTok, YouTube video, Reels, live, webinar&#8230;), music, filter. This preference for this format is visible when we know that video will represent 82% of online traffic by 2022 (source: <a href=\"https:\/\/marketinginsidergroup.com\/content-marketing\/exciting-video-marketing-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cisco<\/a>).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Live shopping is one of the trendy forms of video.
