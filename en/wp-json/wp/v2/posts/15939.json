Not only are they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbrii.com\/customer-survey-white-papers\/wise-investing-customer-surveys-and-roi\/\">one of the most effective ways to build a relationship with your customers, they also are a l<strong>ow investment, easy to use resource that increases your ROI<\/strong><\/a>. However, creating, sending out, and analyzing survey results can be time consuming and difficult if you don&#8217;t have the software necessary <strong>to help you maximize your results and streamline your processes<\/strong>. More and more marketers are looking to smart survey software <strong>to help them send out surveys with the right questions<\/strong>, <strong>at the right time, with the right feel<\/strong>. If your marketing team is looking to invest in a smart survey software, here are some essential things to consider before making your choice.<\/p>\n<h3>#1 Does it help you ask the right questions at the right time?<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re going to invest in a software, the first thing you need to look into is <strong>how smart it really is<\/strong>. The best part about smart survey software is <strong>its ability to help you organize your current data<\/strong> (buyer profiles, sales history, etc.) in order to help tell you when and what you should be asking your customers. If your software doesn&#8217;t offer targeted questioning and comprehensive data analysis, <strong>it isn\u2019t going to help you improve targeting or improve your customer experience<\/strong>, and you should keep looking.<\/p>\n<h3>#2 Does it look good?<\/h3>\n<p>As a marketer, <strong>you know the importance of a good appearance<\/strong>. When things appear confusing, crowded, or simply not aesthetically pleasing, <strong>people tend to click away, and that means losing new leads<\/strong>. Your goal is to have people complete and <strong>submit the survey, so having a professional, clean look <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/what-it-takes-succeed-customer-knowledge\/\">with the right format<\/a> is absolutely essential<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>#3 Will you see a ROI?<\/h3>\n<p>This should be a no brainer. There&#8217;s no need to invest in a software <strong>that isn&#8217;t going to end up working for you and your bottom line<\/strong>, so that you can prove the value of the software to the decision makers at your company. The best way to check this is <strong>to do your research<\/strong>: compare softwares, look at customer reviews, and talk to your sales reps to see what <strong>each software has to offer compared to their price<\/strong>. The right software might be a bit of an investment, but it will pay off in spades once you get a survey strategy going.<\/p>\n<h3>#4 Is there support?<\/h3>\n<p>When you get started with any new software, <strong>you&#8217;re going to have questions<\/strong>. It&#8217;s essential that<strong> the software provider you go with has great customer service and information available to help get you started<\/strong>. And knowing how <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kissmetrics.com\/perfect-saas-support-system\/\">important customer service is for customer retention<\/a>, the survey software you choose should have <strong>top of the line customer care<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>#5 Does it work with what you have?<\/h3>\n<p>This is an important and often overlooked aspect of finding the right survey software system. If your sales and marketing team already uses <a href=\"http:\/\/www.salesforce.com\">Salesforce<\/a> or other CRM software, you might be able to <a href=\"http:\/\/get.myfeelback.com\/en\/salesforce\"><strong>find survey software that integrates with it<\/strong>.<\/a> If so, this will save you time and a lot of hassle, <strong>so make sure to ask your sales rep before purchasing<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>#6 Is it automated?<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2015\/01\/03\/2015-the-year-marketing-automation-finally-catches-on\/\">Marketing automation is growing in popularity,<\/a> and now that there are so many advancements in the world of automation, there is no reason for you <strong>to accept a software service that doesn&#8217;t provide helpful automation features like automatic targeted replies and question formation<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>#7 Do they have an informative blog or how to guide?<\/h3>\n<p>Getting high functioning software is important, but <strong>it&#8217;s equally as important for you to have an information resource<\/strong> that will help you understand the world of surveys and <strong>get you ready to make a campaign<\/strong>. Since you&#8217;re probably not a survey sending expert, <strong>make sure your software provider is<\/strong>. You&#8217;ll want to hook up with a company that provides how to guides, blog posts, downloads, ebooks, and <strong>other useful resources<\/strong> that you can use throughout your journey.<\/p>\n<h3>#8 Is the company focused on your customer experience?<\/h3>\n<p>At the end of the day, what you\u2019re looking for is a software that will <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/why-customer-experience-starts-with-customer-knowledge\/\">improve the customer experience<\/a><\/strong>. Your software should have features that stay focused on this overall initiative. Some of the more generic survey softwares might not be as focused on customer experience, <strong>especially if they are not softwares specifically built for marketing feedback<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Our software makes sure to address all of the issues faced by marketing teams and <strong>give its customers the most up to date and unique features in the industry<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/demo-en\/\">Book your demo now !<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Surveys are a marketers best friend.
