Brick-and-mortar owners will chant that location is everything. IT managers will say the same thing for technology and HR managers will of course say that employees are the most valuable.<\/p>\n<p>While all of these are indeed important, the truth is that they are all aimed towards getting (and keeping) the most important asset of them all \u2013 <strong>customers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In order to protect that asset and offer their customers a better customer service, businesses spend a great deal of money on CRM software.<\/p>\n<p>Why is it then that more than $41 billion is lost each year only in US due to poor customer service?<\/p>\n<p>The reason for that is that many executives <strong>focus only on the \u201cM\u201d part of the CRM, instead of focusing solely on \u201cC\u201d<\/strong>. This leads to a great deal of problems such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mycustomer.com\/marketing\/technology\/the-gartner-view-of-delivering-benefits-and-roi-from-crm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">difficult-to-prove ROI<\/a>, poor adoption, and usage among employees. Since a CRM solution can help <strong>improve sales and customer service only when it is completely adopted and used throughout the whole organization<\/strong>, we bring you 8 ways on how to achieve exactly that \u2013 <strong>amp up your CRM and make it the number one customer acquisition and retention tool in your toolbox.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>#1 Make your CRM easy to use for your employees<\/h2>\n<p>When implemented correctly, a CRM solution can quickly become <strong>the backbone of all your customer relations<\/strong>. This is why the first goal of a CRM implementation should be <strong>to assess your employees and organization\u2019s needs<\/strong>. If you implement a CRM without assessing the needs of your employees, the CRM adoption (and its ROI) will be poor, at least.<\/p>\n<h2>#2 Provide CRM training to your employees<\/h2>\n<p>Making your CRM easy to use is only the first step on your goal to having a high organization-wide CRM adoption. Generally, people fear change and if they are not shown that the change is good, they will resist it. Since the most value of each and every CRM system lies in the data it contains and use of that data, it\u2019s important <strong>to teach every employee how to correctly use the CRM in order to get the maximum results from it<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>#3 Make your CRM a company-wide system<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most frequent mistakes that businesses make is that <strong>they consider the CRM to be only a sales tool<\/strong>. By doing this, they limit or deny access to other customer-oriented departments such as marketing or customer service. By reserving the CRM as a sales-only tool, other departments often end up not knowing of new customers or changes to current customers. This results in a great deal of missed opportunities and crippled relationships.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/blog-customer-feedback-marketing-gold\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to see Companies Increased their Performance using Customer Feedback.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>#4 Keep your data up-to-date<\/h2>\n<p>Most businesses are all part of \u201cdata-hoarding\u201d culture where they amass great amounts of data during their everyday business activities.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.veritas.com\/en\/aa\/news-releases\/2016-03-15-veritas-global-databerg-report-finds-85-percent-of-stored-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Veritas Technologies<\/a>, <strong>52% of all that data is considered as ROT (redundant, obsolete and trivial)<\/strong>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, <strong>data is money, at least when it\u2019s good and up-to-date<\/strong>. Serving your marketing and sales with obsolete data will not result in no money, but it could cost you some, as well.<\/p>\n<h2>#5 Integrate your CRM with social networks<\/h2>\n<p>Today, more than 1,78 billion people login to their Facebook account at least once per month, and that number is constantly growing. Same thing is happening with other social networks. By integrating your CRM with social networks, you can <strong>reach a wider range of potential customers in less time when compared to your competitors that don\u2019t use a social CRM<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>#6 Sync your CRM with your other tools<\/h2>\n<p>Already synced your CRM with social networks? Why stop there? If your CRM doesn\u2019t automatically collect information about important interactions with your customers (emails, meetings), or your employees are entering it manually, <strong>you\u2019ll find it difficult to trust that data to be accurate<\/strong>. This leads us back to point number 7 and ROT data.<\/p>\n<h2>#7 Use CRM through the whole sales cycle<\/h2>\n<p>The sales cycle can start in many different ways: with a call, a meeting, a customer\u2019s inquiry\u2026 <strong>But the sales cycle never ends with a sale<\/strong>. It continues by building loyalty and turning your customers into repeat customers or brand ambassadors. Considering the number of customers that some companies have, keeping track of them, their needs, and different contacts can be difficult. Therefore, it\u2019s <strong>important to use CRM throughout the sales cycle<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>This way, you\u2019ll not only get better understanding of your customers\u2019 current needs, but to <strong>predict their future needs<\/strong> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfeelback.com\/en\/success-stories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fine-tune your future marketing and sales efforts<\/a>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>#8 Use your CRM data to further improve your customer experience<\/h2>\n<p>Besides being a great sales tool, a well-maintained CRM system can quickly become an even better marketing, retention and loyalty building tool. Combining data from your CRM (customer information, specific interests\u2026) with contextual data (location, device type\u2026) and behavioral data (lead source, time spent on page\u2026) you can <strong>generate highly detailed and segmented surveys to send to your customers.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/enrich-salesforce-crm-in-real-time-with-data-from-smart-surveys\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Most CRM systems<\/a> can be easily amped up with a customer survey solution and besides better understanding your customers and their needs, a customer survey solution will give you an in-depth insight on how you compare to your competitors.<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101.png\" alt=\"Download your customer knowledge program\" \/><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101', {}); \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you ask different C-suite executives what is the most important asset in their business, don\u2019t be surprised if you get a bunch of different answers.
