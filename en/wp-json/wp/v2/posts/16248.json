Indeed, it allows you to effectively achieve different business objectives:\u202f\u202f&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Increase the\u202f<strong>conversion rate<\/strong>. During its live shopping, the cosmetics brand Douglas recorded <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/boost-website-conversions\/\">conversion<\/a> rates of\u202f<strong>up to 40%<\/strong>\u202f(source:\u202f<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/capabilities\/mckinsey-digital\/our-insights\/its-showtime-how-live-commerce-is-transforming-the-shopping-experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">McKinsey<\/a><\/strong>).\u202f\u202f\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>How to explain these figures? Direct shopping simplifies access to information. Consumers can see the products from every angle, understand how they work, consult technical data sheets and ask questions live. The icing on the cake, the presence of a\u202f<strong>trusted third party, such as an influencer<\/strong>\u202for a consumer, makes it easier for them to make a purchase.\u202f\u202f&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shorten the sales cycle<\/strong>. During a live shopping event, many factors lead consumers to transition quickly from product discovery to product acquisition. These include: the group dynamic, the desire generated by an entertaining presentation, the reassurance elements provided during the live event (tests, questions, advice&#8230;), and the highlighting of a limited-time promotional offer.\u202f\u202f&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Decrease the return rate<\/strong>. Live shopping makes it possible to make an informed purchase. Thanks to the chat, consumers can ask questions to determine if a product or service will suit their needs. Moreover, the presentation of the items allows the buyers to appropriate them more easily when they receive them. This avoids disappointments and returns.\u202f\u202f&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reinforce its\u202f<strong>brand awareness<\/strong>. In Europe, Direct shopping is relatively rare, which means that the brands who do utilize it will draw a lot of attention to themselves. This is even more true when the live shopping event involves <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/beauty-industry\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">influencers<\/a>. The <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/retail\/\">retailer<\/a> Walmart declared that its number of TikTok subscribers increased by 25% following a live shopping event broadcast on the platform (source:\u202f<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/22\/walmart-will-be-the-first-retailer-to-test-twitters-new-livestream-shopping-platform\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>TechCrunch<\/strong><\/a>).\u202f\u202f&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building\u202f<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/improve-e-reputation\/\">consumer loyalty<\/a><\/strong>. Direct shopping allows brands to present a human face: that of their teams and\/or that of an ambassador. Even better, the entertaining and interactive nature of live shopping makes it a moment of conviviality. This tactic contributes to <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/humanize-customer-journey\/\">building a connection between the company and the shoppers<\/a>. Repeated regularly, it can even become a communication point between a brand and its community.\u202f\u202f&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Live shopping with an influencer: 9 best practices<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, live shopping is an effective marketing tool that can be successfully implemented in your collaborations with influencers.
