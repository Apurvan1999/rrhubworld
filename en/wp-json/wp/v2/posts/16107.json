To manage your customer experience, identify your strengths and detect problems and areas for improvement, you need to build a solid experience measurement system.<\/span><\/p> <p><span lang=\"FR\">Which brings us to the heart of this article: which indicators should you use to measure your experience? Which KPIs enable you to monitor your customers\u2019 satisfaction with the experience you offer? After much thought, we\u2019ve selected 7 KPIs which we believe are key to measuring customer experience. Here they are.<\/span><\/p> <p><span lang=\"FR\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p> <h2><span lang=\"FR\">1 \u2013 Customer Experience and Net Promoter Score (NPS)<\/span><\/h2> <p><span lang=\"FR\">Everybody knows the\u00a0Net Promoter Score, even if you\u2019ve never heard of the term. The Net Promoter Score (or NPS) is a score calculated based on your customers\u2019 answers to the following question: \u201cHow likely are you to recommend our product to others on a scale of 1 to 10?\u201d.<\/span><\/p> <p><span lang=\"FR\">The NPS score is a customer experience KPI. The higher it is, the more likely your customers are to recommend you, and the more satisfied they are. You can therefore conclude that you\u2019ve delivered a quality experience.<\/span><\/p> <p><span lang=\"FR\">The Net Promoter Score is also a tool that enables you to group your customers into three categories, called \u201cpromoters\u201d, \u201cpassives\u201d and \u201cdetractors\u201d depending on their score. This segmentation helps to target your communications and personalise your relationship actions.<\/span><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"650\" height=\"204\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22381 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/NPS-rate.jpg\" alt=\"customer experience\"><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <h2>2 \u2013 Customer Effort Score (CES)<\/h2> <p>The\u00a0<strong>Customer Effort Score<\/strong>\u00a0is another key indicator for measuring customer experience. But whereas the NPS measures the likelihood of your customers to recommend you, the\u00a0<strong>CES evaluates the level of effort exerted by a customer<\/strong>\u00a0to achieve a specific action: an online purchase, signing up to a service online, making a claim, etc.<\/p> <p>In other words,\u00a0<strong>CES measures the seamlessness and simplicity of your customer journey<\/strong>. The less effort a customer has to exert to interact with a brand, the better their experience.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <h2>3 \u2013 Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)<\/h2> <p><strong>NPS enables you to measure the customer recommendation rate. CES, the seamlessness and simplicity of the customer journey. The next indicator is the most well-known and the most basic (which doesn\u2019t make it any less useful!). It enables to directly measure customer satisfaction. It is, of course, the aptly named, Customer Satisfaction Score or\u00a0<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/customer-satisfaction-score-csat\/\">CSAT<\/a><strong>.<\/strong><\/p> <p>CSAT can be used to:<\/p> <ul> <li><strong>Assess overall customer satisfaction<\/strong>, with a generic question such as: \u201c<em>Overall, are you satisfied with the services provided by our brand?<\/em>\u201d or \u201c<em>How satisfied are you with our brand?<\/em>\u201d. This question can be asked at any stage of the customer journey (except right at the beginning when the customer hasn\u2019t had time to form an opinion yet\u2026).<\/li> <li><strong>Assess a specific customer interaction<\/strong>. For example, you could send a survey after an online purchase asking your customers to rate their buying experience.<\/li> <\/ul> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"650\" height=\"316\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22382 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/csat-rate.jpg\" alt=\"customer experience\"><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p><span lang=\"FR\">We\u2019ve now taken a look at the 3 main indicators to\u00a0measure customer satisfaction\u00a0\u2013 indirectly with NPS and CES and directly with CSAT. After all,\u00a0measuring customer experience means, first and foremost, measuring customer satisfaction. If your customers are satisfied, then they are happy with their experience with your brand. Customer satisfaction and customer experience are very closely linked.<\/span><\/p> <p><span lang=\"FR\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p> <h2><span lang=\"FR\">4 \u2013 Customer Retention Rate for Customer Experience<\/span><\/h2> <p><span lang=\"FR\">The customer retention rate is a measure of your\u00a0ability to retain customers. It is a good customer experience KPI. If you can retain your customers, then your experience is probably satisfactory.<\/span><\/p> <p><span lang=\"FR\">Customer retention isn\u2019t just about the quality of your products and services, or your prices. These days, the customer experience as a whole (before, during and after a purchase) creates an attachment (which is sometimes emotional) to your brand.<\/span><\/p> <p><strong><span lang=\"FR\">The retention rate is a KPI that doesn\u2019t lie<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"FR\">. Companies who offer the best customer experiences are also those with the best retention rates.<\/span><\/p> <p><span lang=\"FR\">The retention rate is calculated over a given period. It can be obtained with the following formula:<\/span><\/p> <p><span lang=\"FR\">[(total customers at end of period \u2013 new customers) \/ total customers at beginning of period] x 100.<\/span><\/p> <p><span lang=\"FR\">E.g.: You have 1,000 customers at the beginning of the period. You have 1,150 at the end of the period. Over that period, you\u2019ve registered 300 new customers. Which means that 150 customers have left. Indeed: 1000 + 300 \u2013 150 = 1\u00a0150. So, by applying the mathematical formula above, your customer retention rate is: [(1150 \u2013 300) \/ 1000 ] x 100 = 85%<\/span><\/p> <p><span lang=\"FR\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p> <h2><span lang=\"FR\">5 \u2013 Churn Rate, a Mirror Indicator of the Customer Retention Rate<\/span><\/h2> <p><span lang=\"FR\">Churn refers to an erosion of your customer base.\u00a0<\/span><strong><span lang=\"FR\">The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/resources\/articles\/how-calculate-customer-churn-and-revenue-churn\/#:~:text=Churn%20rate%2C%20sometimes%20known%20as,stop%20buying%20from%20your%20business.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">churn rate<\/a>\u00a0measures the loss of customers over a given period<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"FR\"><strong>.<\/strong> It is calculated by dividing the number of lost customers over that period, by the number of customers at the beginning of the period. The result is multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage. Based on the previous example, the churn rate is: (150 \/ 1\u00a0000) x 100 = 15%.<\/span><\/p> <p><span lang=\"FR\">You\u2019ve probably already noticed: Retention rate + churn rate = 100%<\/span><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"650\" height=\"257\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22383 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/churn-rate.jpg\" alt=\"customer experience\"><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Is your<strong> churn rate<\/strong> high? Your customer experience might not be living up to customer expectations.<\/p> <p>Is your churn rate increasing? This most probably means that your customer experience is deteriorating.<\/p> <p>Whatever your situation, it\u2019s important to pay careful attention to your churn and retention rates.<\/p> <p>Both the retention and churn rates allow to measure customer experience, but neither explain \u201cwhy?\u201d. If your churn rate is very high, then you know that you have a problem in terms of customer experience\u2026 but you don\u2019t know where the problem stems from. Which is why you also need to use the satisfaction indicators listed above: NPS, CES and CSAT.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <h2>6 \u2013 Reactivity to Marketing Campaigns<\/h2> <p>The perceived quality of your customer experience also depends on the quality of the dialogue between you and your customers. This dialogue, more or less personalised and more or less automated and digitalised, takes place at all contact points. Particularly in your marketing communications. Customer marketing is one of the main customer dialogue levers, along with customer service.<\/p> <p>Reactivity to marketing campaigns is calculated through different metrics, depending on the dialogue channel used. For emails, you\u2019d look at the open rate, the click rate and\u2026 the reactivity rate. The reactivity rate is calculated by dividing the number of clickers by the number of openers. The result is then multiplied by 100 to give a percentage.<\/p> <p><strong>Reactivity is not a KPI, but a set of KPIs associated with a channel<\/strong>, which enable you to evaluate the effectiveness of your communications and solicitations. Of course, marketing campaigns don\u2019t make up the entire customer experience, but we think it would be a mistake to not take this parameter into account, along with the\u00a0<strong>management of marketing pressure<\/strong>, when steering your customer experience.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <h2>7 \u2013 Customer experience and Repeat Purchases<\/h2> <p>A key KPI for measuring customer experience is the number of repeat customer purchases. There are two reasons that a customer buys from you again:<\/p> <ul> <li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Your brand has a monopoly on the market.<\/span><\/li> <li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You offer an enjoyable and satisfactory customer experience.<\/span><\/li> <\/ul> <p><strong>So, unless you\u2019re a monopoly, the percentage of customers who return to you each month (the reference period should be adapted to your products\u2019 life cycle) is an important KPI to measure customer experience.<\/strong><\/p> <p>This brings our overview of customer experience KPIs to an end. When well-organised and well-deployed, these indicators can help you build an efficient customer experience management system. They are essential for monitoring the health of your business.
