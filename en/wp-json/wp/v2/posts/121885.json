There are multiple benefits: increased credibility, boosted conversion rates, an enhanced customer relationship, improved SEO\u2026&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article also takes a look at how consumer reviews are key to building a customer-centric strategy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\"><strong>1 \u2013 Customer Reviews Add Credibility to Your Website and Reassure Customers<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Internet users naturally trust their peers\u2019 reviews over brand sales pitches. Which partly explains why advertising is losing its influence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most users read <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/fr\/solution-ratings-and-reviews\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">customer<\/a> reviews to find out more about a company, its products and services. Publishing consumer reviews on your website provides answers to your consumers\u2019 questions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This form of feedback, based on \u201csocial proof\u201d, is a tool that reassures customers and strengthens a company\u2019s credibility. Provided, of course, that the reviews are authentic. This is the only way to gain user trust.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is why at Skeepers, we decided to develop a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.avis-verifies.com\/fr\/?__hstc=56975861.b0e338e1a4a9a325064ff413cb2d89b8.1676470545128.1678799594058.1678802012637.57&amp;__hssc=56975861.4.1678802012637&amp;__hsfp=2481830317\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">platform of<\/a> certified customer reviews. Only customers are allowed to post reviews, which ensures that they are authentic, qualitative and trustworthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also moderate the reviews before they are published on the site and disregard any offensive or insulting ones.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Negative or mixed reviews are also an important part of your customer review collection strategy. They add credibility to the other reviews on the site. Internet users see them as proof of transparency.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since probably have other customer touchpoints, we recommend highlighting (positive) customer feedback in your communication strategy. In other words, by publishing reviews on your product pages, social media, in-store, in your emails, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\"><strong>2 \u2013 Customer Reviews Help Boost Conversion Rates<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This benefit is a direct result of the first. A trustworthy and reassuring website has better conversion rates. Just think about the impact of consumer reviews on product pages!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you probably know, a product page with consumer reviews has a better conversion rate than one without. A recent study shows that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.relationclientmag.fr\/Thematique\/techno-ux-1256\/Breves\/Les-consommateurs-exploitent-mieux-mieux-avis-clients-357013.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">87% of consumers<\/a> read customer reviews before making a purchase. This same study also reveals that going from 3 stars to 4 stars <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/industries\/consumer-packaged-goods\/our-insights\/five-star-growth-using-online-ratings-to-design-better-products\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">increases sales by 24 %<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer reviews remove consumer doubts and concerns, which drives purchases.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend focusing on your flagship products when first collecting reviews. How? By creating an automated review collection scenario after the purchase of these products.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out more, read our article \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/fr\/blog\/avis-clients-impact-ventes-entreprise\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Customer<\/a> reviews directly impact sales\u2019, in which we share the results of a study on the impact of consumer reviews.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\"><strong>3 \u2013 Customer Reviews Enhance Your Customer Relationship<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer reviews\u202f<a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/fr\/humaniser-parcours-clients\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">add a human touch to <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/fr\/reinventer-parcours\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">websites<\/a>: reading a consumer review is more engaging than a product\u2019s technical specs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>consumer reviews can also strengthen your consumer relationship. For at least two reasons\u2026&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, asking for (post-purchase) customer feedback shows that you are listening to your customers, which makes them feel valued. We recommend implementing a solution that proactively collects reviews from your actual customers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, responding to consumer reviews enhances your relationship. Several studies have shown that most customers who read reviews on the internet also read the brand\u2019s answers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>consumer reviews provide an opportunity for brands to exchange with their customers\u2026 and to defuse mixed reviews.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out how to\u202f<a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/fr\/blog\/ratings-reviews-comment-utiliser-avis-clients-ameliorer-produits-services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">use customer reviews to improve your products and services<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\"><strong>4 \u2013 Co<\/strong>nsumer<strong> Reviews Boost Your SEO<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All companies aim to increase traffic to their website. Optimizing your SEO is one of the most powerful drivers to boost your online audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to improve your SEO is to produce value-added content. And what better way to enrich your site with good-quality content than customer reviews? In other words, user generated content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>consumer reviews impact your SEO more than you might expect. A Moz study places customer reviews in the top 5 factors that influence a website\u2019s ranking in Google search results.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is yet another reason to integrate consumer reviews on your homepage, product and solution pages or anywhere else that seems relevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also encourage you to use the Rich Snippets feature, to display star ratings in Google. This will increase your pages\u2019 click-through rate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Capture30-1024x465.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-121918\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Rich Snoppets of BUT brand on Google Shopping<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap5\"><strong>5 \u2013 Customer Reviews are Key to a Customer-Centric Strategy<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer reviews are not just a technique, they are a strategic lever.

The best way to differentiate yourself is to build a customer-centric marketing and product strategy, that focuses on customer needs and expectations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To adopt a customer-centric strategy, you need to know your customers well. Customer reviews are an ideal tool for acquiring this knowledge. Consumer reviews are a goldmine for companies who want to improve their products and services to meet their customers\u2019 expectations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some companies spend several hours a week reviewing their customer feedback to identify any areas for improvement, such as to their product catalog, website, stores, customer service, etc. This approach always pays off and we recommend it to all our clients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap6\"><strong>Conclusion\u202f<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of these reasons is enough to deploy a customer review strategy.
