After their first encounter with this powerful plant, they decided to create a cosmetic brand specialising in vinotherapy. Caudalie was born!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Committed to <\/span><b>sustainable development and becoming a pioneer in natural cosmetics<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Caudalie now aspires to be <\/span><b>the most effective clean brand<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the market.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make the brand stand out on Instagram, Caudalie decided to use nano and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.octoly.com\/everything-you-need-to-know-about-working-with-micro-influencers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">micro-influencers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a driver of renown.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But several questions arised. How to proceed to finding the right <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.octoly.com\/5-ways-to-find-the-best-influencers-for-your-brand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">influencers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the ones who <\/span><b>correspond to the brand identity and deliver quality content<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? How to optimize the management of large-scale micro-influence strategies to save time, especially when you are a small team?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>The Solution<\/h3>\n<div class=\"spadtop p18 left\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often less solicited and always interested in working with brands they really like, <\/span><b>nano and micro-influencers are usually more personally involved in their partnerships<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. For Caudalie, collaborating with these influencers was also a way to optimise the Return on Investment (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.octoly.com\/three-core-ways-to-measure-your-influencer-marketing-roi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ROI<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). <\/span><b>Indeed, they produce quality posts with a very good engagement rate for a lower cost.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose of these collaborations was to meet <\/span><b>two objectives<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The first was to create influencer campaigns to <\/span><b>promote products and attract nano and micro-influencers<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in order to collaborate with them over the long term. The second was to<\/span><b> create an authentic relationship<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with them \u2013 in particular through Octoly\u2019s messaging system \u2013 Caudalie builds and maintains its own community of ambassadors. Gradually, brands follow their development and can identify the most involved influencers to pursue the collaboration as their communities continue to grow.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"spadtop p18 left\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By using <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.octoly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Octoly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and its <\/span><b>community of 30,000 selected nano and micro-influencers<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Caudalie had a large choice to satisfy its requirements while saving time and flexibility in managing its campaigns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to the platform\u2019s <\/span><b>targeting technology<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (socio-demographic targeting, centres of interests, audience, skin and hair type criteria, type of posts, and more), Caudalie was able to <\/span><b>refine<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> its selection. The brand wished to collaborate with a wide range of influencers while remaining <\/span><b>in line with its identity<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Moreover, Caudalie was looking for profiles with a high engagement rate and a close relationship with their community. They wanted to choose influencers who had few paid partnerships with other brands and who were particularly fond of its world and its products so that they could talk about them in a <\/span><b>sincere and authentic<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In March 2020 during the lockdown, Caudalie was determined to launch a new <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.octoly.com\/unique-reach-or-frequency-whats-more-important-in-influencer-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">influencer marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> campaign to <\/span><b>generate enthusiasm over two of its flagship products<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: the Sublimating Sun Oil and the After Sun Tan Prolonging Milk.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using influencer marketing <\/span><b>during this period of health crisis was a strategic way to promote these products and bring some positivity to their target audience<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These campaigns allowed Caudalie to have <\/span><b>high-quality and\u00a0 diverse posts<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and they also received <\/span><b>very positive feedback<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from nano and micro-influencers concerning the efficiency of their products. The icing on the cake? The brand also had the opportunity to boast about this positive feedback in its messaging and communication. A win-win game for everyone\u00a0!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to the <\/span><b>image rights included in Octoly&#8217;s offer<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Caudalie was able to <\/span><b>reuse<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the content produced by the influencers by integrating it directly into its editorial strategy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, this alternative approach of branded and organic content contributed to <\/span><b>boosting the brand&#8217;s editorial line and maximizing engagemen<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t while strengthening its links with its ambassadors.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nano and micro-influencers provide such amazing posts !
