In this article, we&#8217;re going to concentrato on <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">how to use influencer marketing to increase a brand&#8217;s notoriety<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Notoriety is a key indicator for the success of an enterprise: <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">the more known we are, the more consumers talk about us and the more chances we have of making it to their top-of-mind<\/span>. Being part of the consumers top-of-mind would mean an increase in sales, more trafic on our website, successful drive-to-store operations and, in some cases, a better SEO positioning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&#8217;s evident: notoriety is one of the key ingredients for entrepreneurial success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Consistency is key<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;\">One doesn&#8217;t become immensely popular from one day to the next. Think about the most known brands right now: Starbucks, Adidas, Zara&#8230; <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Their brands that have existed and communicated consistently for years<\/span>. Consistency and repetition are what makes the difference with consumers. The more we hear about a brand, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">the more automatically we think about it when we have a concrete need.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;\">At the beginning of the 21st century, to&nbsp; reach these levels of notoriety brands would use traditional marketing channels: TV ads, press ads, radio, in the street, metro, etc. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">However, how much time do you think consumers spent watching these ads?<\/span> A second while turning the pages of a newspaper? 30 seconds while you wait for your movie to keep playing? An instant while waiting for the metro? Nowadays, consumers spend, on average, between <a href=\"\/en\/influencer-marketing-2021-key-points\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">30 minutes and one hour<\/a> on social media. Traditional campaigns required enormous costs and effort to provide results, whereas <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">social media has a direct, much more durable impact at a more affordable cost.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;\">This doesn&#8217;t mean that a single successful social media campaign will suffice to cement your brand image and reach the much coveted top-of-mind. On social media, you&#8217;ll need at least <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2 key elements<\/span> to reach a truly remarkable level of notoriety:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">  <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Time<\/span>. Time is essential with consumers. Just like we feel a special bond with our childhood friends, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">we especially value brands with whom we have history<\/span>. Depending on the efficiency of your campaigns, your niche sector and the second key element (which we&#8217;ll see soon) you&#8217;ll need more or less time to establish this privileged relationship with your audience, but one thing&#8217;s for sure: it&#8217;ll never happen from one day to the other.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Consistency and repetition.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">The more you talk about your brand, the more rapidly you&#8217;ll reach your notoriety objectives. It&#8217;s essential to reinforce your brand image in the mind of the customer. In order to achieve this, collaborations with microinfluencers are the ideal strategy: <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">they&#8217;re trustworthy ambassadors, very appreciated by their communities, that&#8217;ll perfectly know how to convey your message on social media<\/span>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Communicating values<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There&#8217;s an important difference between increasing a brand&#8217;s notoriety and becoming viral, a difference that one must understand. They&#8217;re not the same thing, and can be beneficial under different circumstances:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">  <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Virality is an exponential increase of a brand or a product&#8217;s notoriety in a very short period of time.<\/span> However, this very rarely translates into long-term notoriety for a brand. It&#8217;s a frantic period of time during which a lot of people are talking a lot about you, all at the same time. It can be over as rapidly as it starts. When can it be beneficial to go viral? For instance, for a <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">product launch<\/span>. A product is a concrete element we want to popularize. Our objective will be to increase its sales. Virality can also be used in other cases, like to promote an engagement, a particular offer, a challenge&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> \ufe0f <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Notoriety consists in building a complete and durable knowledge of your brand in the market and general public<\/span>. An increase in notoriety comes about much more slowly than virality, and doesn&#8217;t depend on a specific product or engagement, but more so on the DNA of your brand, your values, your image, colors, history, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For these reasons, when launching a campaign that has the objective of increasing your notoriety, it&#8217;s important to <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">communicate the elements that construe the essence of your brand<\/span>. Share your values and create diverse campaigns to make the whole of your products, engagements and aspirations be known. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">This will bring you closer to your consumers and will increase your brand notoriety.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The role of a brand ambassador&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;\">Los influencers-embajadores&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;\">Knowing the key elements to increase your brand notoriety are time, continuity and communicating the DNA of your brand, which influencers should you choose to launch your campaigns? The answer is, obviously, <a href=\"\/en\/brand-ambassadors-influencers-difference\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">influencers-ambassadors<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;\">Influencers-ambassadors&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> \ufe0f Collaborate with you long-term. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">This is ideal when the strategy you have in mind needs consistency for success. Moreover, your customers will have much more trust in an ambassador-influencer that proves his love for the brand with continuated communication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> They&#8217;ll end up knowing your brand perfectly. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">From force of habit and continuous collaboration, they&#8217;ll become true experts of your brand, they&#8217;ll truly understand your offer, objectives and aspirations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u2705 Have a strong connection with your values. <\/span>Influencers become brand ambassadors for the brands with whom they share values, the same universe and even some personality traits. They&#8217;re the ideal profiles for notoriety campaigns.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold; text-align: center;\">***<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;\">You know posses all the keys to understanding notoriety campaigns and being able to implement them yoursuelf in your influencer marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: justify; font-size: 12px;\">Photo credit: Priscilla du Preez via Unsplash<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Influencer marketing is a marketing tool that can be used to reach diverse objectives.
