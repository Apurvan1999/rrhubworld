KM software tools often <strong>compile customer information<\/strong> across different points of contact between the customer and the business: email, website, phone, social media, and in-store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer-facing staff especially, benefit these kind of tools as they receive detailed information about customers\u2019 purchase histories, buying preferences and concerns, which enables them to assist customers <strong>more efficiently<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud-based <strong>data solutions<\/strong>&nbsp;also known as SaaS (software-as-a-service), are especially powerful as customer information can be <strong>accessed anywhere, anytime<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the tools or techniques used to manage knowledge, all KM initiatives share <strong>three common features<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Identification of critical knowledge<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, a company must identify which knowledge and information is <strong>most valuable<\/strong> to the success of the business. Is the goal to reduce operational costs?&nbsp; Reduce wait times? Cross sale?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Identifying priorities is essential so that the business can <strong>properly structure <\/strong>systems, tools and processes aimed at retaining and sharing the most critical information. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/knowledge-management-improves-customer.jpg\" alt=\"identification KM\" class=\"wp-image-19466\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Collection, storage, and organization of critical knowledge<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once goals have been set, a business must <strong>develop a process<\/strong> and the right tools in order to collect and store the knowledge and information. Regardless of how this is done, the critical knowledge must be stored in a location and format which can be <strong>easily found<\/strong> and accessed by users. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/knowledge-management-improves-relations.jpg\" alt=\"customer management storage\" class=\"wp-image-19471\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Sharing knowledge and information between users<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowledge Management facilitates sharing to provide more effective customer service. All customer agents have access to the same product, service, and customer information. Therefore, <strong>no matter whom<\/strong> a customer may speak to, he or she is guaranteed to receive <strong>consistent answers<\/strong>. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/knowledge-management-customer-relations.jpg\" alt=\"sharing customer knowledge\" class=\"wp-image-19465\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">How Knowledge Management Improves Customer Relations?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>KM is an integral aspect of customer relationship management. Through Knowledge Management, a business <strong>can track<\/strong> the number of calls, emails, questions that have been asked and resolved, but also <strong>which issues <\/strong>are most frequently discussed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this way, a business can see <strong>how customers typically interact<\/strong> with its products and services, providing opportunities for the business to make any necessary <strong>improvements<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowledge management also increases customer satisfaction through<strong> self-service capabilities<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An FAQ page and personal account information can be included on a website, for example, thus eliminating the need to speak directly with an agent, helping customers get the answers they want, fast. In fact, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/questions-to-avoid-in-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recent Superoffice survey<\/a>, 70% of customers said they expect a company website to include self-service options. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-knowledge-management-improves-customer-relations.jpg\" alt=\"KM to improve customer relationships\" class=\"wp-image-19464\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Customer feedback tools<\/strong> further optimize KM. Feedback forms, such as online surveys or opinion polls, can be strategically placed on a website or included in an email.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If customers see a simple <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/questions-to-avoid-in-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">survey<\/a> with the option to respond or not, and can also see how others have responded, they may feel more inclined to speak up and share their own experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"discover_more\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\">Improve your customer relations by asking questions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of <strong>centralizing knowledge<\/strong> to improve customer service are enormous, but you need to be retrieving valuable information from your customers to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making sure you are <strong>collecting good data<\/strong> on your customers is essential, this will enable you to know how to better serve them.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/knowledge-management-improves-customer-relations-questions.jpg\" alt=\"asking questions\" class=\"wp-image-19468\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you need to make sure you are asking the right questions in order for build&nbsp;<strong>sparking customer relations.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many types of questions you can ask, pre- and post-purchase, but also many ways to ask this question.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/knowledge-management-improves-customer-relations-survey.jpg\" alt=\"survey\" class=\"wp-image-19469\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, an effective Knowledge Management system will help customers get the&nbsp;<strong>right kind of assistance<\/strong>&nbsp;and quicker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, as all employees have access to the same information, customers will receive consistent service no matter whom they speak to.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowledge Management initiatives focused on meeting well-defined, achievable goals, and implemented with best practices in mind, establish a <strong>long-term <\/strong>competitive advantage as they improve <strong>overall customer experience<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n<p><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-18b20ddf-9442-4e43-96fd-b04fe925544b\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-18b20ddf-9442-4e43-96fd-b04fe925544b\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-18b20ddf-9442-4e43-96fd-b04fe925544b\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]&gt;-->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/20304540\/18b20ddf-9442-4e43-96fd-b04fe925544b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"hs-cta-img-18b20ddf-9442-4e43-96fd-b04fe925544b\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/18b20ddf-9442-4e43-96fd-b04fe925544b.png\" alt=\"Memo 15+ examples of open-ended questions\" width=\"700\" height=\"231\"><\/a><\/span> hbspt.cta.load(20304540, &#8217;18b20ddf-9442-4e43-96fd-b04fe925544b&#8217;, {&#8220;useNewLoader&#8221;:&#8221;true&#8221;,&#8221;region&#8221;:&#8221;na1&#8243;}); <\/span><\/p>\n<p><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Known under the acronym KM, Knowledge Management plays a very important part in your relations with your customers.
