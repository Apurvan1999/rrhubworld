According to a Microsoft study, 80 \u2013 90% of customers <em>\u201care looking for a better experience across devices and [are] more willing to share information than they were two years ago.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Customer Retention and understanding Customer Needs are much tied<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most obvious cost of not knowing your customers\u2019 changing needs is the inability to keep the ones you\u2019ve worked so hard to acquire. The additional cost of acquiring new ones which, on average, is 7 times more expensive. You won&#8217;t be able to hold on to your existing customers without customer knowledge. Your lack of customer understanding will make it very difficult to effectively give them what they need, when they need it, which is exactly what today\u2019s customers expect.&nbsp;86% of customers admit they are willing to pay up to 25% more for a higher level of personalized service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-needs-retention.jpg\" alt=\"customer-needs-retention\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if customers cannot get what they need from you, they\u2019ll get it somewhere else.

Companies need to leverage customer information to offer personalized support, crucial to growing and retaining a healthy customer base. And to deliver the customized and highly personalized products, services, and experiences your customers increasingly demand, you will need to have in place efficient means with which to understand them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedback surveys are one of the most efficient way to research and better know your customer: their requirements, their feedback on your products and services, their level of satisfaction with your customer support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/feedback-survey-understand-customers-needs.jpg\" alt=\"feedback-survey-understand-customers-needs\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedback surveys will help you <strong>answer all the pressing questions you have to design and deliver a better overall experience<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do you know what your customers really want and need? Is your information current?<\/li><li>Do you know who your most valuable customers are and how to meet their needs?<\/li><li>Do you understand common needs that all of your customers have, as well as the unique needs of each segment?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to feedback surveys, your customer relationship management system (CRM) holds valuable information about your customers that will help you to understand their needs. Look for patterns: when your customers typically make orders, problems customers experienced, how quickly you&#8217;re responding to orders or delivering goods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand your customers well, you need to be attentive to them whenever you are in contact with them. Knowing and being able to immediately respond to their changing needs will greatly improve your chances of delivering the exact experience they are looking for, which will drive loyalty, maintain your reputation and, ultimately, improve your bottom line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For these reasons, no business can afford to overlook<strong> the importance of gathering and using updated customer knowledge to better engage customers <\/strong>and, ultimately, sell more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-b8b5ff35-f9f9-4b33-be7d-9e72d5fa8101\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--><\/span><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n\n\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n<p><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/20304540\/50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"hs-cta-img-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1.png\" alt=\"15 questions to know your customers needs and expectations\" width=\"700\" height=\"223\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Maintaining up-to-date customer information is essential for any online business.
