For brands, it&#8217;s <strong>a key solution to promote their products<\/strong>. But you need to understand how it works and how to use it. Read on to discover our 6 best practices and 5 things to avoid at all costs!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Live Shopping: What Not to Do&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Don\u2019t Forget to Define Your Live Shopping Goals Beforehand<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to define goals for each live session! Why? Because it maps out the steps to follow, so that you <strong>know exactly what you are working towards<\/strong>. With clear objectives, you can also measure the <strong>impact <\/strong>of your event and identify any areas for improvement, or actions to implement next time. Don\u2019t forget to identify the <strong>KPI<\/strong>s (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.qlik.com\/us\/kpi#:~:text=KPI%20stands%20for%20key%20performance,the%20organization%20make%20better%20decisions.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Key Performance Indicators<\/a>) you want to analyze either.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few examples of live shopping KPIs:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Number of people who joined the live&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maximum number of users (viewer peak)&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Number of logins \/ IP addresses&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Number of participants who watched the live for more than X minutes&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Number of viewers on mobile devices&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Average cart value&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Never Improvise During a Live Shopping Event&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Any good live shopping event needs a bit of spontaneity. But <strong>don\u2019t confuse \u201cspontaneity\u201d with \u201cimprovisation\u201d<\/strong>! If you improvise, you may end up jumping from one subject to another and losing <strong>your audience<\/strong>. Your live event will still feel authentic with a pre-defined structure and you are more likely to achieve your objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Don\u2019t Underestimate the Importance of Chat&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Live shopping, unlike TV shopping networks, allows viewers to <strong>converse with brands in real time<\/strong>. Consumers watch live sessions to discover products, but also to get <strong>advice <\/strong>and <strong>answers to their questions<\/strong>. Remember that an answer to one consumer\u2019s question could help other viewers too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also recommend interacting with the chat to engage your viewers and <strong>relay important information, links or special offers, as well as to moderate it<\/strong>. You can call on <strong>your own employees<\/strong> as moderators.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Don\u2019t Forget About Replays&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to <strong>promote your replay video<\/strong> after a live shopping event! Replays can <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/questions-ask-yourself-before-adding-videos-amazon-product-pages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">enhance your product pages<\/a> or <strong>showcase upcoming events<\/strong> and your online store. They enable you to <strong>reach a wider audience<\/strong> and consumers who couldn\u2019t make the live session. After all, live shopping continues to convert sales long after the original session is over!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Forget One Shots\u2026 Regular Live Shopping Events Are the Key to Success!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take the example of a weekly prime-time TV show: viewers know that every Friday at 9 p.m., their favorite show will air. They wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. Live shopping is the same. Try to create regular conversational moments to:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8211; <strong>Keep your brand at the top of customers\u2019 minds<\/strong> &nbsp;<br>&#8211; Maintain a <strong>long-lasting relationship of trust<\/strong> with your customers&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One-off lives will only boost your sales for a short period of time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6 Good Practices for Successful Live Shopping<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Create a Reusable and Adaptable Structure<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend a <strong>consistent structure<\/strong> <strong>that can be adapted<\/strong> to the themes or objectives of each live shopping event. This will not only <strong>save time<\/strong>, but also boost your confidence because you have a plan and know how it will unfold, which will in turn <strong>reassure your audience<\/strong>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>For example:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce your brand&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Present a product&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Explain its benefits&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Show how to use the product&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Answer questions about the product<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Once you\u2019ve created your outline, you can use it whenever possible.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Invite an Industry Expert or Influencer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts add <strong>credibility<\/strong> to your message and products. They promote <strong>trust <\/strong>in your brand and can <strong>provide key information<\/strong> about your products. Influencers, on the other hand, bring a <strong>fresh energy<\/strong> to the table, and you can <strong>target their community<\/strong> as well as your own.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/screen-la-redoute-claudia-1024x584.png\" alt=\"La Redoute live shopping event - influencer - bad and good practices - skeepers\" class=\"wp-image-116917\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Example of a La Redoute live shopping event with influencer @Claudia.dfce<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/boost-visibility-influencers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>invite influencer<\/strong><\/a><strong>s who are a good fit for your products<\/strong>. Your live session should appeal to your audience as well as theirs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Leverage Sales Seasons and Holidays<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is simple: viewers will relate to your content and <strong>your products and services will be useful at that given time<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you could <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/fr\/blog\/ventes-fetes-fin-annee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">take advant<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/christmas-customer-experience-how-to-prepare-this-year\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">age of Black Friday<\/a> to promote Christmas gifts: coats, games, beauty products, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then during the summer, highlight summery products that are useful for that season. For example, Easypara streamed a live session about sunscreen on the 1<sup>st<\/sup> day of summer in 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Captureeasypara1-1024x573.png\" alt=\"Easypara sunscreen - live shopping event - Skeepers \" class=\"wp-image-116924\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Easypara sunscreen live shopping event, 06\/21\/22.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Offer Live Shopping Giveaways and Promotions&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Make your viewers feel <strong>special<\/strong> by offering giveaways or promo codes during live shopping events. This adds a <strong>gamification<\/strong> element which will make your audience want to join other sessions, to <strong>benefit from exclusive deals<\/strong>.&nbsp;<br>Micromania uses this technique to engage its community and build loyalty. During live sessions, viewers can benefit from promotional codes and enter giveaways. The winners are announced during the live event!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Diversify Your Content<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Diversifying your content means inviting experts, building partnerships, changing your location, switching up your theme, not promoting products you\u2019ve already featured in previous live shopping events, etc. The idea is to create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.neoxperiences.com\/retailtainment-the-phenomenon-that-combines-retail-and-entertainment?lang=en#:~:text=What%20is%20Retailtainment%3F,place%20of%20entertainment%20or%20leisure.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">retailtainment<\/a> (combine <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/retail\/\">retail<\/a> and entertainment) which is key to <strong>retaining customers during and after the live<\/strong>. Viewers don\u2019t get bored, so they\u2019re <strong>more likely to come back<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Partner Up to Renew Your Content<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaborate with one of your partners during a live session to <strong>promote never-before-seen products<\/strong> for your viewers, as well as a new brand or company that shares your values. As mentioned above, this is another way to diversify your content. Not to mention that you will <strong>benefit from the partner brand\u2019s visibility and audience<\/strong>. Take Monoprix, for example, and its live shopping event with Barilla, one of its partner brands. Their combined knowledge and tips created an effective and dynamic live shopping session.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CONCLUSION&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you know how to make your next live shopping event a success! With the emergence of social shopping, this channel is set to grow in France and around the world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-71aceefd-84b9-4f17-9970-29ade23101f3\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-71aceefd-84b9-4f17-9970-29ade23101f3\" id=\"hs-cta-71aceefd-84b9-4f17-9970-29ade23101f3\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/20304540\/71aceefd-84b9-4f17-9970-29ade23101f3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-71aceefd-84b9-4f17-9970-29ade23101f3\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" height=\"340\" width=\"1700\" src=\"https:\/\/no-cache.hubspot.com\/cta\/default\/20304540\/71aceefd-84b9-4f17-9970-29ade23101f3.png\" alt=\"2023-EN-SKP-LS-CTA-Discover our solution\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(20304540, '71aceefd-84b9-4f17-9970-29ade23101f3', {\"useNewLoader\":\"true\",\"region\":\"na1\"}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Did you know that 70 % of European consumers are interested in live shopping?
