Here are 7 tips that you may never have thought of to create an effective survey.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Create an Effective Customer Survey<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve explored this question several times on this blog. Particularly in <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/online-survey-deploy-on-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our article with tips for creating a successful online survey<\/a>. You may remember that we recommended defining your survey goals beforehand, personalising your surveys, and asking short and simple questions.<\/p>\n<p>Now here are seven new tips to make your customer surveys more effective than ever.<\/p>\n<h2>Tip 1: Remember to Introduce your Surveys<\/h2>\n<p>Remember to write an introductory sentence or paragraph at the beginning of your survey.<\/p>\n<p>The aim is to make your customers want to take part:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>By involving them in the survey<\/strong>: show them that their opinion really counts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>By explaining why you created this survey, what your aim is<\/strong>. Your customers want to know why they are taking part in the survey and what their answers will be used for.<\/li>\n<li><strong>By thanking them for taking part.<\/strong> Remember that today\u2019s respondents are tomorrow\u2019s respondents.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also mention how long the survey will take to complete. Your customers will appreciate your honesty.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 601px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-survey-introduction.jpg\" alt=\"Survey introduction\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Tip 2: Don\u2019t Ask &#8220;Useless&#8221; Questions<\/h2>\n<p>A &#8220;useless question&#8221; can be a question that doesn\u2019t provide qualified answers, or a question that simply rephrases one you\u2019ve already asked.<\/p>\n<h3>The Disadvantages of Useless Questions:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly, they are of no use to you (by definition!): you won\u2019t learn anything more about your customers from the answers to these questions. So, why ask them? Don\u2019t forget that you\u2019re asking your customers questions to get to know them better, not just for fun.<\/li>\n<li>Secondly, they make your survey unnecessarily long, which can have a negative impact on your response rate. Generally speaking, the longer the survey, the lower the response rate.<\/li>\n<li>Thirdly, useless questions may irritate your customers.<\/li>\n<li>Finally, they tend to slow the survey\u2019s momentum down.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget that a survey should produce answers that lead to actions. Always bear this in mind. By very definition, you cannot use a useless question.<\/p>\n<h2>Tip 3: Make your Surveys Dynamic<\/h2>\n<p>It is important to captivate the customers who take the time to complete your survey, to ensure that they are concentrated and motivated from beginning to end. Your survey should be upbeat, dynamic, coherent, and logic. To build a dynamic survey, we recommend using a funnel or hourglass structure, for example. This is easy to implement and often very effective.<\/p>\n<h3>A Funnel Structure<\/h3>\n<p>Start by asking generic questions before gradually moving towards more specific, technical, circumstantial, or personal questions.<\/p>\n<h3>An Hourglass Structure<\/h3>\n<p>Start with generic questions, then move on to specific questions, before coming back to generic questions at the end.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 251px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/survey-structure.jpg\" alt=\"Survey structure\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Tip 4: Adapt your Question Style to your Target<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve broached this subject briefly in previous articles. The style of your questions should be adapted to your target. You wouldn\u2019t address young people in the same way as you would seniors. You wouldn\u2019t use the same words, turn of phrase, or tone.<\/p>\n<p>Hence the importance, once more, of defining your survey target beforehand. Always bear in mind who you are talking to when you write your survey. Be customer-centric!<\/p>\n<h2>Tip 5: Use Scale Answers<\/h2>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, a survey should provide you with new qualified data about your customers and\/or leads. However, the definition of answer choices has an impact on the quality of the answers themselves.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, binary answers, such as \u201cYes\/No\u201d, \u201cTrue\/False\u201d or \u201cAgree\/Disagree\u201d tend to provide less interesting and less useful information than scale answers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 415px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/question-system-usability-scale.jpg\" alt=\"Scale surveys\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The more precise your answer choices, the richer and easier-to-use the information will be.<\/p>\n<p>We therefore recommend avoiding binary answer choices whenever possible. More generally, take the time to think about your answer choices, and not just your questions. A survey is made up of questions, but also answers!<\/p>\n<h2>Tip 6: Ask Open-ended Questions to Expand on Closed Ones<\/h2>\n<p>Should you include open questions in your surveys? A lot of survey writers are unsure about this. Open questions require more analysis because they are qualitative. But open questions sometimes enable you to acquire information that would be difficult to obtain otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>Here is one of the ways to effectively use open questions in your customer surveys: associate open-ended questions (qualitative) with closed ones (quantitative).<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 563px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/survey-open-closed-questions.jpg\" alt=\"Open closed questions survey\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Following or preceding a closed question with an open-ended will enhance the quality of your answers.<\/p>\n<p>For example, start by <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/voice-of-customer-new-products-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">asking your customers if they are satisfied with the products you sell<\/a>. Then, ask an open-ended question asking them which adjective they think best describes your products. Or start with an open question, such as: &#8220;What do you think about [Company name]\u2019s customer service?\u201d. Then in the next question, ask your customers to rate the quality of your customer service on a scale of 1 to 5 (for example).<\/p>\n<p>The results from both questions (open-ended and closed) will allow you to cross-check and therefore strengthen the quality of your answers.<\/p>\n<p>More generally, associating an open-ended question with a closed one, can help link the open question to the rest of the survey, ensuring that it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Doesn\u2019t come out of nowhere and ties into the rest of the survey.<\/li>\n<li>Isn\u2019t too general. Finishing a survey with &#8220;Any comments?&#8221; isn\u2019t always the best idea! There is a strong possibility that your respondents simply won\u2019t reply.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Tip 7: Use Various Question Formats<\/h2>\n<p>We mentioned earlier that an effective survey should be dynamic. There should be a logical thread running through your survey, that captivates your respondents\u2019 interest from beginning to end (like a novel, or a film). Your survey should have a storyline.<\/p>\n<p>This brings us to our final tip: try, insofar as possible, to vary the format of your questions, so that your respondents don\u2019t get bored. Keep them on their toes! For example, avoid starting all your questions with \u201cDo you\u2026?\u201d or \u201cIn your opinion\u2026?&#8221;. Your survey should be varied, with &#8220;how&#8221;, &#8220;why&#8221;, &#8220;when&#8221;, &#8220;where&#8221; and \u201cwhat\u201d questions.<\/p>\n<p>Use everything the English language has to offer to phrase your questions differently and approach them from various angles.<\/p>\n<p>This will enable you to obtain more thought-out answers. It is really important to ensure that you don\u2019t turn your respondent into a robot, answering mechanically.<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-11691149-fe46-43e9-9f33-4d0b1d404b66\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-11691149-fe46-43e9-9f33-4d0b1d404b66\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-11691149-fe46-43e9-9f33-4d0b1d404b66\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/11691149-fe46-43e9-9f33-4d0b1d404b66\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-11691149-fe46-43e9-9f33-4d0b1d404b66\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/11691149-fe46-43e9-9f33-4d0b1d404b66.png\" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" \/><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n hbspt.cta.load(744484, '11691149-fe46-43e9-9f33-4d0b1d404b66', {\"region\":\"na1\"}); \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Building a quality customer survey will help you obtain better response rates and therefore get to know your customers better.
