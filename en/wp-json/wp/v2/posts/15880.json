Depending on the customer\u2019s score, they are placed into one of 3 categories: <strong>Promoters<\/strong>, <strong>Passives <\/strong>or <strong>Detractors<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 281px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/net-promoter-score-customer-profiles.png\" alt=\"net-promoter-score-customer-profiles\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>A score of 9 or 10: Promoters<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Promoters<\/strong> show <strong>the most loyalty and enthusiasm <\/strong>towards your company, and will continue to buy your products while recommending your company to friends and family. To be considered a promoter, customers must provide a <strong>very high rating <\/strong>(a minimum of 9). This ensures that the category represents your company\u2019s most enthusiastic fans.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 496px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/promoters-net-promoter-score.jpeg\" alt=\"promoters-net-promoter-score\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Promoters can play a significant role in your marketing strategy.

Here\u2019s an image showing the calculation method:<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">Net Promoter Score = % Promoters &#8211; % Detractors<\/p>\n<p>The Net Promoter score is between -100 and 100.<\/p>\n<h2>Why is it important to have a high Net Promoter Score?<\/h2>\n<p>The Net Promoter Score, developed by Fred Reichheld, is a way of measuring customer loyalty. This strategy was initially designed to show how customers would portray a company to their friends, families and colleagues. Reichheld maintains that a company\u2019s <strong>results are strongly linked <\/strong>to their <strong>future growth. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.netpromotersystem.com\/about\/how-is-nps-related-to-growth.aspx\">Research by Bain Company<\/a>\u00a0shows that companies who achieve sustainable, profitable growth\u00a0 have NPS scores that are two times higher than the average. Apple, Amazon and Zappos are often cited as examples.<\/p>\n<h2>The Net Promoter Score, an indicator of customer satisfaction or brand recognition?<\/h2>\n<p>It is often challenging for companies to steer all of their departments towards a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/crucial-steps-creating-customer-centric-business\/\">customer-centric<\/a> approach. Proponents of this measurement tool state that the Net Promoter Score is aimed at evaluating customer satisfaction, and that the easy-to-understand method encourages the entire company to implement and maintain<strong> customer-focused strategies. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Though the NPS does not provide detailed information about customers, the simplicity of this system allows companies to <strong>quickly and effectively implement these strategies.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Critics of the NPS state that this tool shows a customer\u2019s attitude and intention to recommend the brand, rather than their actual behaviour, and that the Net Promoter Score does not provide sales indicators or information about future growth, such as product innovation or changes to pricing strategies.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 433px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/kpi-satisfaction-net-promoter-score.jpg\" alt=\"kpi-satisfaction-net-promoter-score\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Net Promoter Score is simply a way of <strong>measuring quality and customer satisfaction, <\/strong>rather than brand recognition, brand equity or market power.<\/p>\n<h2>The Net Promoter Score, primarily a way for customers to share their opinions<\/h2>\n<p>The most important thing to keep in mind is that <strong>customers <\/strong>have more opportunities than ever to <strong>share their opinions.<\/strong> These opinions can, of course, either benefit or hurt your brand. The NPS is a strategy that enables companies to <strong>measure customer loyalty<\/strong>, and is often <strong>used successfully<\/strong> by many companies who are looking to gain insight on customer satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p>Whether your company uses the NPS or another method of measuring customer loyalty or satisfaction, the goal is the same: determine the most effective ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/power-questions-better-customer-experience\/\">improve the customer experience<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-381919ff-e7c9-4fd1-aff8-9ed948a2e4e6\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-381919ff-e7c9-4fd1-aff8-9ed948a2e4e6\" id=\"hs-cta-381919ff-e7c9-4fd1-aff8-9ed948a2e4e6\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/20304540\/381919ff-e7c9-4fd1-aff8-9ed948a2e4e6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-381919ff-e7c9-4fd1-aff8-9ed948a2e4e6\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" height=\"340\" width=\"1700\" src=\"https:\/\/no-cache.hubspot.com\/cta\/default\/20304540\/381919ff-e7c9-4fd1-aff8-9ed948a2e4e6.png\"  alt=\"2023-EN-SKP-FM-CTA-Discover our solution\"\/><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(20304540, '381919ff-e7c9-4fd1-aff8-9ed948a2e4e6', {\"useNewLoader\":\"true\",\"region\":\"na1\"}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If your company has implemented strategies to measure customer satisfaction and loyalty, you\u2019ve almost certainly heard of the Net Promoter Score (NPS).
