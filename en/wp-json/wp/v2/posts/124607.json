After being embraced by teenagers, the app became essential for a much wider audience. Today, for influencer marketing, TikTok is a mainstream media which makes plenty of influencers blossom<\/span><b>. To conduct a successful marketing campaign, one must know some of the app\u2019s functionalities. <\/b><\/p><h2><b>TikTok in 2021, the key figures<\/b><\/h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a report published by App Annie, a specialized company in mobile data analytics, <\/span><b>the average watch time on TikTok reached 21.5 hours per month<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and therefore overtook Facebook for the first time in January 2021. With a 325% increase in one year, the social network is in the midst of a growth phase and has not even reached its peak.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, a particular aspect proves its power: According to the same report, <\/span><b>TikTok should be reaching 1.2 billion users worldwide<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> this year. Why? It is simple: TikTok <\/span><b>offers super creative video content which triggers the continuous desire to post, watch and share<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> what the others do.<\/span><\/p><h2><b>Who are the influencers on TikTok?<\/b><\/h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TikTok <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.octoly.com\/the-dos-and-donts-of-communicating-with-influencers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">influencers<\/a> are actually nothing different from those on\u00a0 Instagram. Moreover, while the filters and all the creative features have a prominent place on Instagram, other elements make TikTok less formatted than its fellow apps. More colorful, funnier, today it is <\/span><b>the trendiest social network and the other ones are trying to keep up with.\u00a0 <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By comparing Instagram\u2019s Reel format with TikTok\u2019s interface you can easily convince yourself. As if that were not enough, users <\/span><b>share TikTok content to their Instagram Stories. <\/b><\/p><h2><b>How to get to work with TikTok influencers<\/b><\/h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TikTok is an actual playing field for influencing marketing campaigns. Between unsaid rules and free choices, one must find the right balance.<\/span><\/p><h3><b>Rather prefer accounts that were first created on TikTok, even though they are successful elsewhere<\/b><\/h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the time, <\/span><b>the content that has been originally posted on TikTok has a major influence <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">than that which landed there after having involved a large community elsewhere. This is not a general truth, but it can be interesting to see <\/span><b>TikTok as a world of its own, with its own stars<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p><h3><b>Find appropriate hashtags<\/b><\/h3><p><b>Hashtags shall simply define your campaign<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that\u2019s why it is important to think about them as short <\/span><b>slogans<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The brand Veet France has recently chose the hashtag #<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00c9<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t\u00e9libert\u00e9 (literally \u201cSummer freedom\u201d) to celebrate the end of lockdown through influencers and Lipton France has shared the hashtag #LiptonG\u00e9n\u00e9rationTri (literally \u201cLipton waste sorting generation\u201d) to promote its recycled plastic bottle.<\/span><\/p><h3><b>Do not focus only on the macro-influencers<\/b><\/h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Betting on an account with millions of followers is obviously a guarantee of visibility. Though this kind of visibility<\/span><b> can be superficial, it does not always make people feel involved<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and doesn\u2019t always determine the success of your campaign. Niche <\/span><b>nano<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.octoly.com\/what-nano-and-micro-influencers-bring-to-the-table\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> micro influencers<\/a> represent an opportunity to <\/span><b>promote products<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of many sectors <\/span><b>among a more attentive community, which is closer to the TikTok account you collaborate with.<\/b><\/p><h3><b>Give influencers a certain amount of freedom<\/b><\/h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Especially on TikTok, <\/span><b>it is essential to be creatively free<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you want your influencer campaign to be successful, let the influencers freely create their videos. This does not mean that you are not allowed to define the topic with them, though let them express their true selves and<\/span><b> involve their communities by sharing genuine creative content.<\/b><\/p><h3><b>Be trendy, stay genuine<\/b><\/h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Topics that aim at bringing about change, such as the fight against climate change, have to be used carefully on TikTok and other platforms. You really do not want to be involved in greenwashing or be seen as an opportunist! <\/span><b>First of all, you need to offer a real product or solution <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in order to collaborate with <\/span><b>the right influencers who try to stay true to themselves and to keep bonding with their communities.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TikTok is a phenomenon that is no longer limited to one category of people. Even though the app primarily benefits teenagers and young adults, TikTok\u2019s content is the result of <\/span><b>creativity, humor, sensitiveness and can involve everyone. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s good news for an influencer campaign!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use an <\/span><b>influencer marketing platform<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like Octoly to guide you through your campaigns, from briefing to results analysis and to connect you to the TikTok influencers that match your brand!<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partnering with an influencer platform like <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.octoly.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Octoly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> connects you to a community of over 40k carefully selected influencers who meet your needs thanks to our targeting criteria.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure that the influencer talks about your product, a credit system is set up on the platform and guarantees an authentic review of your product in exchange for sending it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, Octoly offers to <\/span><b>take care of the shipping of your products<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at real cost as well as personalization options to strengthen your relationship with your influencers!\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><b>Sources<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014 <\/span><b>App Annie<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Report The State of Mobile 2021<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.appannie.com\/en\/go\/state-of-mobile-2021\/<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Demander une d\u00e9mo<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Articles similaires<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":124608,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"post_folder":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.6 -
