When this happens, it can feel like a very negative thing for a CRM manager.<\/p>\n<p>The negative criticism could be about a <strong>specific interaction<\/strong> the customer had with your company, which means it&#8217;s isolated from your actual product. But it could also originate from frustration over a product that didn&#8217;t work as planned, or issues with your customer service, marketing team and so on.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/value-customer-criticism.jpg\" alt=\"value-customer-criticism\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When these issues happen, companies often freak out and don&#8217;t dare to face the issue. Yet\u00a0<strong>the best thing to do <\/strong>is to remind yourself that customer criticism is a normal part of working with a business and <strong>prepare to spring into action<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 2: Act fast to customer criticism<\/h2>\n<p>When you get a <strong>customer complaint<\/strong>, the most important thing to do is <strong>to react to it<\/strong>. Don&#8217;t ever turn a blind eye and\u00a0let a customer&#8217;s complaint just sit there.<\/p>\n<p>It can be very dangerous, because by not responding, you are basically telling your customer <strong>you don&#8217;t care <\/strong>about them, and this is the number one reason why customers leave a company. No, it&#8217;s not because of your prices as many may think!<\/p>\n<div class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 309px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/95393933-1.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>\n<div>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.superoffice.com\/blog\/customer-complaints-good-for-business\/\">Why Customers Leave A Business.<\/a>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>When you receive a complaint, <strong>meet with your team<\/strong> to come up with a <strong>game changer plan<\/strong> of how you want to respond.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on what the complaint or criticism was, you will want to take a <strong>different approach<\/strong> that addresses each individual concern.<\/p>\n<p>A negative customer experience can usually be rectified with a<strong> personal apology <\/strong>and some sort of <strong>monetary reward<\/strong>. A customer who is dissatisfied with a product may require something <strong>more substantial<\/strong>, like a <strong>written explanation <\/strong>that the problem with the product is being resolved.<\/p>\n<p>See this example here of how a company responded to a negative feedback about a login issue on their website, by letting the customer know that her complaints were heard, and that the teams were working on finding a quick solution.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/email_complaint_answer.png\" alt=\"email_complaint_answer\" \/><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Whatever response you decide on, the key is to <strong>act fast<\/strong>.

Companies often think about collecting other types of information in order to gain more customers, but they forget about the existing customers that are already there and need to be taken care of.<\/p>\n<p>Neglecting your customers is one of the things that hurts companies the most, yet many continue to close their eyes to the pain.

They\u00a0won&#8217;t walk away from a company after a bad experience as long as the problem gets solved.<\/p>\n<p>Herein lies the hidden value of customer criticism. The fact that you received the criticism gives you <strong>the chance to do something about it<\/strong>, and that can mean the difference between keeping and losing a customer.<\/p>\n<p>The real customer experiences you need to worry about are the <strong>unsatisfied customers who don&#8217;t speak up <\/strong>and express their concerns. These customers will often end up leaving your company, and will <strong>relay their bad experience<\/strong> to friends and family.<\/p>\n<h2>First hand advice, a hidden value for your company<\/h2>\n<p>The other hidden value of customer criticism is that <strong>it&#8217;s first hand advice on how to make your company better<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>If someone is informing you about an issue with your product, that insight is essentially <a href=\"http:\/\/thethrivingsmallbusiness.com\/what-are-the-5-benefits-of-customer-complaints\/\">a free assessment of your product<\/a>\u00a0and saves your team the trouble of having to guess <strong>how to improve your product for next time<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Hearing that a customer had a <strong>bad experience<\/strong> with a customer service representative is really a form of<strong> advice on how to make your company better<\/strong> (clearly, you need to work on customer service in this case.)<\/p>\n<p>For this reason, next time you receive customer criticism, look at it as an <strong>opportunity to improve<\/strong>, and a last minute chance to save a customer from adding to your churn.
