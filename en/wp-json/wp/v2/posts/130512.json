Is the content creator growing steadily? Can you spot any abrupt changes in the size of their audience? Are there significant and mostly suspicious increases or decreases in their follower growth? Does the influencer have a large community of followers, but you notice that their engagement is decreasing? This analysis in comparison mode of the performances over a long period of time allows you to identify possible anomalies.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">For instance, a micro-influencer who doesn&#8217;t engage his audience or whose interests are completely opposite to your brand will result in wasting time and money. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Data will allow you to find the best opinion leader to partner with and target the right people in the right place at the right time<\/span> (the right formula).<\/p>\n<p><strong>The 3 main questions to ask yourself are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #999999;\">Who are <strong>the most engaging KOLs<\/strong> (influencers) to promote your brand\u2019s publications?&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Are they part of your<strong> business industry<\/strong>?&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>How is your brand perceived by the potential influencers?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Capture-decran-2021-07-19-a-17.05.21.png\" alt=\"Talkwalker tool_Hivency blog\" width=\"465\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 465px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\">Photo credits : screenshot from Talkwalker.com<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Optimizing content with real-time data<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Data also has a relevant use in creating a strong <\/span><strong><a href=\"\/en\/integrate-influencer-content-social-media-strategy\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span>content marketing strategy<\/span><\/a> <\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">by providing real-time information about:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What are the current <strong>trendy topics<\/strong> in your industry?
