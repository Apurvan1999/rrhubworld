The longer a website can<strong> hold their attention<\/strong>, the more loyal customers become.<\/p>\n<p>However, many website visits are never converting into sales, due to <strong>site abandonment<\/strong>, or bounce rate (percentage of visitors who arrive on a website, visit one page, and then leave). Of course, the<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>higher bounce rate the lower chances youu&#8217;ll get to<strong> convert visitors into leads and sales<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/bounce-rate.jpg\" alt=\"bounce rate\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In order to help business owners <strong>understand<\/strong> what could be causing customers to abandon their websites, here is an overview of five<strong> common errors <\/strong>business owners make with their websites and <strong>how to correct <\/strong>these errors.<\/p>\n<h2>1- Communicate a clear value proposition to your customers<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nngroup.com\/articles\/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\u201dnofollow\u201d noopener\">Nielsen Norman Group<\/a> reports that a website must communicate a clear value proposition<strong> within 10 seconds<\/strong>. If a website passes this initial harsh judgment, it means the customer is<strong> likely to stay<\/strong> on the website longer according to the study, usually from 2 minutes upwoard, which is \u201c<em>an eternity on the web<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/value-proposition.jpg\" alt=\"value proposition\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A value proposition clearly expresses a company\u2019s value, what customers can expect when they buy from the company. More specifically, a value proposition answers<strong> four key questions <\/strong>every shopper has:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What product or service is the company selling?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the end-benefit of using it?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Who is the target customer for this product or service?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>What makes the offering unique and different?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For two good examples, see <a href=\"https:\/\/geekdom.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Geekdom<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/squareup.com\/us\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Square<\/a>, both of them express clear value propositions on their landing pages.<\/p>\n<h2>2- You are not attracting the right traffic to your website&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>High bounce rates can indicate that you aren\u2019t clearly presenting who you are and what you have to offer.Therefore, you are <strong>not attracting the right people<\/strong>. To address this problem, there are a few things you can check:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Review meta descriptions <\/strong>to ensure that you aren\u2019t misrepresenting what your site is about. Descriptions should generally point to what the site has to offer,<strong> inspire curiosity<\/strong>, use common keywords, and be no longer than 155 words or Google will truncate it. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/the-2-user-metrics-that-matter-for-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Pete Meyers<\/a>, who is specialized in studying Google algorithms, optimizing meta descriptions are <strong>crucial for SEO<\/strong> because:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p>\u201c<em>whether or not a result gets clicked on is one of Google\u2019s and Bing\u2019s first clues about whether any given result is a good match to a query<\/em>.\u201d\u00a0 &#8211; Dr. Pete Meyers<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So, one key to attracting the right customers, driving clicks, and increasing conversions is to write relevant snippets of information.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/website-traffic.jpg\" alt=\"website traffic\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on keeping<strong> high rankings for your branded terms <\/strong>so people who know you can easily find you. Pretend you\u2019re a customer for your own service, which keywords would you search for? The best is to ask your customers directly how they found you.<\/li>\n<li>Constantly<strong> fine-tune your website targeting <\/strong>to better capture the right visitors. Consider, for example, posting <strong>links on Reddit <\/strong>which is an invaluable source of free traffic. Find the most relevant Reddit thread related to your niche and, during peak user hours, post links on it to your own website.You can also post content that positions you as the <strong>authority on a given subject<\/strong> matter, content which your prospective buyers search for when looking for a new provider like you. Regular blogging is an effective way to do this,\u00a0HubSpot reports that undervaluing the importance of frequent blogging is equal to leaving money on the table. According to its findings, businesses that regularly blog see a<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/5014\/Study-Shows-Business-Blogging-Leads-to-55-More-Website-Visitors.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">55% increase<\/a> in website traffic<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>3- You&#8217;re Ignoring mobile responsiveness<\/h2>\n<p>In today\u2019s world, a responsive,<strong> mobile-friendly website is necessary<\/strong> for any business.

Of course, designing a mobile-friendly site requires more work, but it will offer greater rewards as it is more likely to<strong> generate more leads <\/strong>and convert leads into<strong> loyal customers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Now you understand the importance of considering how customers engage with a website.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201c<em>Today\u2019s consumers are on the go and regularly shift between desktop, mobile, and tablet devices throughout the day.
