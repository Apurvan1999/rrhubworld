To launch a global, year-long influencer strategy<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> it&#8217;s advisable to know these dates<\/span> in order to profit from them through your influencer campaigns.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is the difference between a key commercial period and a key date?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A period of time during which the number of sales is higher than usual, which is predictable and repeats itself every year is a &#8220;key commercial period&#8221;. For instance:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Christmas Holidays;<\/li>\n<li>Back to school season;<\/li>\n<li>Winter sales, summer sales.;<\/li>\n<li>Black Friday;&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A key commercial period lasts, as a general rule, longer than a day. Another one of its characteristics is that they tend to be universal: <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">every brand of every sector communicates massively<\/span> as Black Friday approaches, during Christmas Break, etc. and a great number of countries celebrate these events.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, a key date is a concrete day dedicated to an event or value. For instance:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Valentine&#8217;s Day;<\/li>\n<li>Mother&#8217;s Day;<\/li>\n<li>National Holidays;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some key dates are internationally known (like Valentine&#8217;s Day) which means many brands already communicate around this time period. However, most key dates are less known and vary from one country to another.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Communicating during key commercial periods<\/span> is evident and something that brands have been doing for years. Key dates also offer the opportunity to showcase creatively and communicate with influencers. What&#8217;s more: key dates correspond <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">to the habits and culture of each country<\/span>. Getting to know these key dates and what they represent will bring you closer to your audience.
