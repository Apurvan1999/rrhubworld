And at a time when <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/business\/consumer\/americans-feeling-less-satisfied-shopping-experience-n308236\" style=\"line-height: 1.6;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most American\u2019s feel less satisfied with the service they receive from retailers<\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">, <strong>Nordstrom\u2019s ability to develop customer engagement is impressive.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>So how do they do it?<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tCustomer Data<\/h2>\n<p>Nordstrom takes great care to understand product and brand relationships, <strong>figuring out how to promote the right brand and product to the right customer<\/strong>, maximizing profits in the process.<\/p>\n<p>The company collects volumes of data from their website and stores, as well as through their social networks, Facebook (836,260 followers), Instagram (1.2 million followers), and Twitter (49.2 thousand followers).<\/p>\n<p>The company has taken their data collection process a step further, creating their very own \u201c<em>Innovation Lab<\/em>\u201d which utilizes data from across all channels to augment and enhance the customer experience. Among it\u2019s various creations, the Innovation Lab has created an app that provides employees with customer profiles based on information customers provide if they so chose.<\/p>\n<p>The app enables employees to access information related to customer purchase history, preferences, and even what they shopped for but couldn\u2019t find. Armed with more information about each customer, store employees can tailor their service to the specifications of the customer.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tCustomer Champions<\/h2>\n<p>Robert Spector, author of <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/The-Nordstrom-Customer-Service-Excellence\/dp\/1118076672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Nordstrom Way to Customer Service Excellence<\/a><\/em>, has studied the shop for decades.<\/p>\n<p>A key lesson he shares in his book is the way in which the company empowers its employees, or \u201cNordies\u201d as they are sometimes called. Upon employment with the company, Nordies receive a card on which is written the one rule that all employees must abide by: \u201c<em>Use good judgment in all situations<\/em>.\u201d The company\u2019s employees are given complete freedom to take care of customers and, if a mistake is made, at least it will be made in the customer\u2019s favor.<\/p>\n<p>It is this kind of service that regularly places <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theacsi.org\/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=149&amp;catid=&amp;Itemid=214&amp;c=Nordstrom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nordstrom at the top of satisfaction rakings<\/a>. Despite the store\u2019s generally higher prices and lack of sales (\u201c<em>We don\u2019t do the 50%-off-everything-in-the-store sale,\u201d <\/em>former chairman Bruce Nordstram once said), Nordstrom clearly resonates with customers, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2011-08-11\/how-nordstrom-bests-its-retail-rivals#p2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">delivering a high-end shopping experience like no other<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The company shows that customer satisfaction is not all about promotions and gimmicks. The key to pleasing customers comes down to one simple thing \u2013 offering quality service.<\/p>\n<p>Quality service has provided Nordstrom with a clear competitive edge. Indeed, it could be that the retail giant is better known for its service than the actual merchandise it sells. In many ways, Nordstrom is the ultimate service-drives-sales business, weathering economic downturns and changes to the retail industry.<\/p>\n<p>By rethinking the \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d attitude of most retailers, Nordstrom has carved out its own niche, finding smart and innovative ways to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\t\tHelp customers find what they are looking for faster.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\t\tHelp customers check out faster.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\t\tBuild a personal relationship with each customer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\t\tCreate a unique and branded shopping experience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\t\tProvide customers with opportunities to spread positive word of mouth.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>\n\tCustomer Innovation<\/h2>\n<p>Nordstrom invests quite a bit of time and money on customer-centered innovation, with its Innovation Lab receiving much attention.<\/p>\n<p>Working with customers, the Innovation Lab\u2019s \u201cdata scientists\u201d have designed, among other creations, an iPad app to help shoppers select sunglasses and a real-time cross-channel inventory app that helps customers see when and where a product is available and, if ordered, when they can expect to receive it.<\/p>\n<p>And, of course, customers can buy items they see on the retailer\u2019s Pinterest and Instagram accounts, a digitally-savvy move which further improves the retailer\u2019s reputation, especially with younger, social media-minded shoppers.<\/p>\n<p>The company\u2019s goal is to create the finest in-store and on-line shopping experience possible. For instance, the Nordstrom app allows shoppers to reserve clothes they like and find them hanging in a fitting room upon entering the store.<\/p>\n<p>Then, mobile check out makes it simple for employees to see customers through the payment process, rather than sending them to a cash register to complete their transaction.<\/p>\n<p>However, if a customer pays at a register, they can be assured an equally high level of service, as all employees are instructed to never push a bag across a counter but, instead, walk the bag around a counter and hand it to the shopper.<\/p>\n<p>These are all small touches, but the accumulative power of multiple small gestures like these cannot be overlooked. Customers want to feel valued and it\u2019s the retailer\u2019s ability to do just that time and again which has made customer satisfaction Nordstrom\u2019s real point of differentiation.<\/p>\n<p>As President Blake Nordstrom once famously said, \u201c<em>It\u2019s not about us being ranked on top or \u2018best in class.\u2019 It\u2019s about what\u2019s best for the customer. In fact, forget \u2018best in class\u2019. The customer is consistently raising the bar, and since they are setting the standard, we\u2019re constantly resetting ours\u2019 upward.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\" id=\"hs-cta-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\"><!--[if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--> <a href=\"http:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Download Ebook How Top Fortune 500 Companies Increased Their Performance Using Customer Feedback\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7.png\" style=\"border-width:0px;\"><\/a> <\/span> <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n\n        hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7', {});\n    \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span> <!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>American retailer Nordstrom is known for its legendary customer service.
