Certainly,<br \/>because they associate the passage to the act of purchase with a conversation with a service<br \/>provider.<\/p>\n<p>Social networks are a particularly effective lever for salespeople: 71% of the decision-makers<br \/>interviewed for this function believe that social networks help them in their business.<br \/>Presently, purchases made after contacts on the networks mainly concern service activities.<br \/>They represent 2\/3 of them.<\/p>\n<p>The software and hardware products arrive then. In terms of amounts, 88% of sales still amount<br \/>to less than 10K \u20ac.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Social networks grow strongly in BtoB<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Regardless of the objective pursued (publicizing your company, doing the business intelligence,<br \/>discovering potential partners or suppliers), the use of social networks in the workplace has greatly increased.This channel is also considered to be more &#8220;business-oriented&#8221; than before: while 74% of<br \/>decision-makers considered social networks &#8220;less commercial than other media&#8221; in 2018, they<br \/>are now only 70%.<\/p>\n<p>This finding does not interfere with the connections, quite the contrary. 64% of decision-makers<br \/>have already responded to a commercial solicitation from someone they did not know (+11 pts<br \/>vs 2018).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>B2B: Social networks are increasingly influencing sales The corporate world seems to succumb to the siren calls of Social Selling: according to a study,the impact of social networks on the BtoB act of purchasing would have more than tripled in ayear &#8230;According to the 2nd edition of the Social Selling Barometer conducted by La Poste&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":28,"featured_media":16176,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"post_folder":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.6 -
