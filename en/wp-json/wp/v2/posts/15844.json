This means that you should <strong>set a goal<\/strong> for your survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your company has launched a <strong>new product or service<\/strong>, focus your questions around it. Or perhaps you&#8217;d like to expand your business, then you can develop your survey to <strong>spot trends<\/strong> in consumers&#8217; buying habits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the case is, here are some <strong>best practices<\/strong> you\u2019ll need to apply when developing your survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1 &#8211; A survey to help drive actionable insights<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Asking your customers<strong> relevant questions <\/strong>with clearly defined objectives is very important. Your survey needs to be easily understood and you should <strong>limit your visitors&#8217; effort<\/strong> as much as possible. Doing so will add focus to your survey, keeping your customers&nbsp;<strong>engaged<\/strong> and providing you with more useful feedback.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">So yes, you know you want customer feedback and that&#8217;s good, but why? What are you aiming for?<\/span> &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-satisfaction-survey-goals.jpg\" alt=\"customer satisfaction goals\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p> &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Before you begin the process of<strong> designing your survey<\/strong>, ask yourself what you need to know, why, and <\/span><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">limit your questions to the absolute essentials<\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Do you need information about a specific service or product?\u200b<\/span><\/li><li><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Are you attempting to trouble shoot a problem area in the customer journey? <\/span><\/li><li><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">What\u2019s raising red flags? <\/span><\/li><li><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Will you target a specific market segment or a broader consumer base?<\/span><\/span><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Your goal is to <strong>improve business decisions<\/strong>, so ask specific and focused questions which <strong>delivers actionable insights<\/strong> to create positive change.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2 &#8211; Avoid asking leading questions in your customer satisfaction surveys<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Leading questions run the risk of frustrating or even <strong>alienating a customer<\/strong>. At their worst, they can seem manipulative and dishonest which is <strong>not what you&#8217;re aiming for<\/strong>&nbsp;at all when surveying your customers.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Asking a question like, \u201c<em>How quickly did we resolve your problem?<\/em>\u201d assumes you have solved the problem. Don\u2019t assume anything. Prefer a question such as :&nbsp;<\/span> &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/leading-question-survey.png\" alt=\"satisfaction-survey\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p> &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Hopefully, your company has been responsive but if it hasn\u2019t, you want to know. The <strong>truth may be unpleasant<\/strong> but take it for what it\u2019s worth: an <strong>opportunity<\/strong> to close a loop, address a problem, or fine-tune a current process. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Remember: you are trying to build a better company<\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">.

Turn unhappy customers into <strong>supporters<\/strong> by showing them that you are actually listening and t<strong>aking into consideration<\/strong> their feelings, needs, complaints, etc.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">If they know that you are giving them this <strong>opportunity to speak up<\/strong> about anything good or bad, and that you will actually act on it, they will be loyal customers.<\/span> &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer_satisfaction_survey_csat.png\" alt=\"customer satisfaction survey \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p> &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">This leads us to another extremely important point, <strong>acting on the feedback<\/strong>.
