People can love a multitude of things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But wait, <strong>why are we talking about love in an article dedicated to the customer experience?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quite simply because the best customer experiences are very similar to love. They are extremely tough to design, but when you get it right, <strong>you can make your customers love you for life<\/strong>. And the reason why it is so challenging to create an exceptional customer experience is very simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experiences are all about human interactions. There are scientific explanations, but above all, it&#8217;s about emotions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as we can see in Maslow&#8217;s triangle, emotional needs transcend physical needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-needs.jpg\" alt=\"customer needs\" class=\"wp-image-19890\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer experience has become so important in recent times that several firms of analysts regularly publish indices. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forrester.com\/report\/The+US+Customer+Experience+Index+2020\/-\/E-RES161037?objectid=RES161037\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forrester&#8217;s US Customer Experience Index<\/a> covers a significant proportion of industries such as airlines, hotels, insurance, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what happens if you&#8217;re not a service company, but rather an organization like AirBnB, Uber or WhatsApp? Who does the customer talk to when WhatsApp doesn&#8217;t work or when the Uber App is not responding?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\">How does Uber deliver an excellent customer experience?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to the world of product experience &#8211; a subset of customer experience, highly appreciated by design specialists, and of immense importance to organizations that cannot afford (or do not want) to spend a lot on marketing or customer service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Product experience is <strong>what the consumer remembers about the product through the various stages of interaction<\/strong> with it (purchase, first use, current use, abandonment, etc.).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the experience point of view, the three dimensions within which a product must perform are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>the functional,<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>the sensual,<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>and the emotional.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/product-dimensions.jpg\" alt=\"uber experience\" class=\"wp-image-19891\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These aspects are independent of the economic dimensions of the product such as the cost, price or efficiency of production (which are equally important attributes).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1 \u2014 Functional experience<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The question that any product must answer is: <strong>what is the basic functional human need the product is intended to meet?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it a need for transport, for accommodation, for knowledge or something else?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We often speak of the functional value created by the product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2 \u2014&nbsp;Sensual experience<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody loves unattractive cars irrespective of the speed they can achieve. <strong>Beauty is a matter of taste, but things must be pleasant to see and hear.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some even believe that a smell can evoke an experience (aromatherapy in hotels, spas or restaurants is a good example). As a matter of fact, people rarely judge a book by its cover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So make sure you tell a great story that solves a big problem, but be sure that it is beautiful and appeals to the senses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-19892 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Uber-experience.gif\" alt=\"uber experience\" width=\"650\" height=\"434\"><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3 \u2014&nbsp;Emotional experience<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What emotional response does your product evoke in its user?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A sense of power, well-being, belonging, attachment, aversion, pleasure or pride?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking into account the wide variety of customers you want to reach in a B2C universe, there is no single formula.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You must invest time in studying your customers&#8217;
