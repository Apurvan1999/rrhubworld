It is also a highly cost-effective investment because <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/10\/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">retaining a customer is 25 times cheaper than acquiring a new one<\/a>. But how can you satisfy customers?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this article, we\u2019ll take a look at a few techniques and tips to satisfy your customers without transforming your entire organisation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1 \u2014 Get to Know Your Customers to Better Satisfy Them<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your customers will be more satisfied if you offer services or products that they like or want. Finding out more about your customers is therefore <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">key to generating satisfied customers. If you know your customers well, you can serve them better. Your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CRM, as well as your ability to enrich it with easy to analyse and activate customer data, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is therefore an essential prerequisite for <\/span><strong>measuring customer satisfaction<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several ways to get to know your customers better. A particularly efficient technique involves asking your customers questions <strong>directly via <\/strong><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/cx-management-en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>smart surveys<\/strong><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. After all, the best way to get to know your customers better is to ask them questions!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2 \u2014 Provide Personalised Customer Service and Increase Satisfaction<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers like to be treated like human beings. Who enjoys receiving emails that have been sent to thousands of others? One way to humanise your customer relationship is to add some personal touches.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it\u2019s easier to personalise the way you address your customers if you already know them. <strong>Once more, <\/strong><\/span><strong>customer knowledge <\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>is key.<\/strong> Take the previous example of a marketing email. You can only personalise it if you already have certain information, such as the recipient\u2019s first and last name.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personalisation should feed into your entire customer relationship. It should become your philosophy. A <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">good quality customer service<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that handles all requests and takes into account all their specificities, contributes greatly to customer satisfaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you\u2019re an online retailer, adding an instant messaging service to your online store is a real plus. Unlike emails or traditional contact forms, instant messaging provides a real opportunity to stand out and to add a human touch to your customer relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3 \u2014 Step into the Customer\u2019s Shoes and Show Empathy<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re head of marketing or a customer relations manager\u2026 you\u2019re a customer, too. We all have a customer experience. It is therefore quite easy to step into the customer\u2019s shoes when thinking about how to better satisfy them. Think about your own experience as a customer\u2026 You\u2019ll probably learn a lot!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, you can\u2019t read your customers\u2019 minds. <strong>Which is why customer knowledge tools are so important.<\/strong> Stepping into your own customers\u2019 shoes is the best way to empathise with them and to make the right decisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More generally, this attitude that consists in always putting the customer first, placing them at the centre of all decisions, has already proved its worth. It is known as <strong>a customer-centric approach and is key to customer satisfaction<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4 \u2014 Adopt Flexible Management Techniques that Directly Impact Customer Satisfaction<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personalising the customer relationship implies a certain closeness between your customers and those in direct contact with them. For example, employees in sales positions and customer services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to give your employees a certain amount of autonomy, so that they can serve customers in the best possible way and answer their requests as quickly as possible. If a salesperson has to constantly refer to their upper management before answering customer requests, the customer relationship is likely to be less responsive and therefore of lower quality. This will inevitably have an impact on customer satisfaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees in direct contact with customers can also teach you things about your clientele. It is very important to involve these employees in any customer satisfaction though processes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transforming your customers into satisfied customers is good. Transforming dissatisfied customers into loyal promoters of your brand is even better! Does this sound like an impossible challenge? Think again and find out how to <\/span><strong>turn an at-risk customer into an ambassador<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are 4 ways to quickly increase customer satisfaction:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improve your customer knowledge to meet their needs<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provide quality and personalised customer service<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step into the customer\u2019s shoes and show empathy<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adopt a customer-centric management in which employees are autonomous and focused on the customer<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>4 Simple Ideas to Quickly Satisfy your Customers 23 July 2021 4 Simple Ideas to Quickly Satisfy your Customers 23 July 2021 Customer satisfaction is key to keeping your customers.
