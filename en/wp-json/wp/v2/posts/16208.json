We&#8217;ve been witness to digital events and even fashion collections presented through the form of video games. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">This digitalization makes it essential to have a strong brand presence on social media.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span>Nowadays,<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> product placement is no longer enough<\/span> to stand out with influencer marketing. In this article, we&#8217;lle be focusing on other aspects of this tool, essential <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/fashion-industry\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to the fashion industry<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\">Influencers guarantee the image and notoriety of the brand<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Product placement is particularly efficient for sales campaigns.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">However, notoriety campaigns have the objective of reinforcing the brand image. We&#8217;re talking about two very different kinds of campaigns, with entirely different, albeit complementary objectives.
