The company\u2019s continuing efforts to forge a relationship which is mutually beneficial to itself and its customers have sustained the chain\u2019s popularity and spurred its economic growth.<\/p>\n<h2>Three Important Benefits of Brand Loyalty<\/h2>\n<h3>Repeat Purchasing<\/h3>\n<p>12 \u2013 15% of customers are loyal to a single company. And these same customers are responsible for 55-70% of a company\u2019s sales. In other words, <strong>even a small group of brand enthusiasts can help a business\u2019s bottom line<\/strong>. Imagine what could happen when a business gains an even higher percentage of brand loyalists.<\/p>\n<p>Take Netflix, for instance, who has recently posted <strong>a 24% sales gain thanks to a loyal following of 60 million users<\/strong>. The streaming service, known for <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/how-netflix-rose-from-the-ashes-by-becoming-customer-centric\/\">exceeding customers\u2019 expectations<\/a>, has successfully maintained \u2013 and grown \u2013 its followers, warding off competition and improving its net worth in the process.<\/p>\n<h3>Word of Mouth<\/h3>\n<p>Loyal customers are valuable not only because they are repeat customers but also because they build word of mouth. People are, on average, twice as likely to pay attention to friend, family, and colleague recommendations than from any other sources.<\/p>\n<p>Case in point: Etsy, the company that allows consumers to buy unique, handcrafted items directly from people all over the world. The company made the decision long ago to forego traditional advertising methods, instead relying solely on word of mouth, a move that has paid off very well. As of this year, the company is valued at $1.2 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line: A single repeat customer could be worth many, many new customers, not to mention jumps in revenue and net worth.<\/p>\n<h3>Product Positioning<\/h3>\n<p>Determining your brand\u2019s position is key to creating \u2013 and maintaining \u2013 brand loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>A brand\u2019s position &#8211; what your brand stands for and what the customer can expect from you &#8211; will be the first thing a customer thinks about when he or she hears your name.<\/p>\n<p>Consider Nike whose famous and motivational <em>\u201cJust Do It\u201d <\/em>tag line clarifies the company\u2019s position. When you think of Nike, you think of all things athletic: running, biking, basketball. And, of course, Nike has the products to allow anyone to participate in (or just do) those activities, making its products popular with people from every background.<\/p>\n<p>Strong brand loyalty has enabled the company to shift its product focus into an attitude and a lifestyle which consumers everywhere seek out.<\/p>\n<h2>Three Steps to Efficiently Measure Brand Loyalty<\/h2>\n<h3>Screen and segment first thing<\/h3>\n<p>Begin by screening and segmenting all responses, as the wrong mix of participants will likely invalidate your branding survey.<\/p>\n<p>Consider <strong>asking demographic questions at either the beginning or the end of the survey<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Demographic questions are generally quick and easy to answer but may lead to drop out if they are the first thing participants see.<\/p>\n<h3>Likelihood to recommend<\/h3>\n<p>To gauge brand loyalty, use a <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/ecommerce-create-happy-customers-nps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Net Promoter Score survey<\/a>\u00a0 &#8211; or one similar to it &#8211; and ask customers how likely they are to recommend your brand to friends or colleagues. Then compare your score against industry <a href=\"https:\/\/www.satmetrix.com\/nps-benchmarks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">benchmarks<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Brandon Rocks, head of data science at Satmetrix, clearly identifies the various important benefits of using NPS to gauge brand loyalty: <em>\u201cA high Net Promoter Score means that a company is more likely to experience lower customer acquisition costs, greater customer lifetime value and, ultimately, more sustainable growth.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Product Satisfaction<\/h3>\n<p>To better understand how satisfied customers are with the quality, value, or the features of a product or service, <strong>a survey can provide valuable information about brand satisfaction and product experience<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Customer satisfaction is fundamental measure of gauging a company\u2019s performance no matter what service or product the company provides.<\/p>\n<p>And, as with your Net Promoter Score, reading your results against industry benchmarks will help you <a href=\"https:\/\/d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net\/content\/resources\/benchmarkQ22015_zz.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">better understand how you measure up against competitors<\/a> and your industry.<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--> <a href=\"http:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d.png\" alt=\"Download Ebook How to Learn from your Customers and Get Ahead of your Competitors\" \/><\/a> <\/span> <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n\n        hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d', {});\n    \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span> <!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s no secret that it\u2019s much less expensive to keep an existing customer than to find a new one.
