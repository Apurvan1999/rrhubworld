Go? No go? The best way to decide is to evaluate the\u00a0<strong>return on investment<\/strong>. In this article, you\u2019ll be able to see for yourself that user-generated videos generate an ROI on several levels. Read on to discover the 4 immediate ROIs you\u2019ll get from implementing SKEEPERS&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/solution-user-generated-video-en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">user-generated video solution<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\"><strong>1 \u2013 A direct impact on conversions&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"chap1\">User-generated videos combine the power of video with the&nbsp;<strong>authenticity of customer reviews<\/strong>. They can be shared on social media, in your email campaigns\u2026 or they can be added directly to your product pages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have many retail clients. They all have one simple goal:&nbsp;<strong>improve conversions on their product pages<\/strong>. Of the 100 people who visit your product page, how many will buy? Of course, you want that number to be as high as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, user-generated videos allow e-retailers to bump up conversions on their online stores. This is one of the main use cases for <a href=\"https:\/\/get.skeepers.io\/en\/bc\/lightonline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">User-generated videos<\/a> and also an immediate ROI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"099a\"><strong>Improve your product pages with user-generated videos&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The<strong>&nbsp;importance of product pages<\/strong>&nbsp;has been stressed for years now \u2014 in fact, since the start of the whole e-commerce adventure. When shopping online, it\u2019s product pages that make all the difference. We\u2019ve known the formula for optimizing product pages and their conversion rate for a long time:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>High-quality images showing the product from all angles.<\/li><li>A detailed and engaging description that answers your potential customer\u2019s questions.<\/li><li>Displaying key information prominently: price, shipping, etc.<\/li><li>An efficient and clear page structure.<\/li><li>\u2026\/\u2026<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>User-generated videos take your product page optimization to a whole new level.&nbsp;Discover the example of <a href=\"https:\/\/get.skeepers.io\/en\/bc\/petit-bateau\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Petit Bateau<\/a>, a famous French clothes brand for babies and children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand received&nbsp;<strong>hundreds of applications from customers keen to make videos<\/strong>. Using the SKEEPERS platform, the marketing team can pick the right profiles and automate the entire post-production process. Once the videos have been edited and approved by the team, they\u2019re displayed on the relevant product pages and shared on social media:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"099a\"><strong>How do you accurately calculate the ROI of your user-generated videos?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With SKEEPERS&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/solution-user-generated-video-en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Custom Video Player<\/a>, you can\u00a0<strong>track each video\u2019s results and its impact on your conversions<\/strong>\u00a0using a data-driven approach. For example, for our client <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berceaumagique.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Berceau Magique<\/a>, adding user-generated videos to product pages\u00a0<strong>increased their conversion rate by<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>40% on average!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To calculate the ROI of videos, you have to calculate their impact on conversions. Let\u2019s assume, for example, that your e-commerce site generates 100,000 sessions per month and a conversion rate of 2%. In other words, 2% of sessions end with a customer order, for a total of 2,000 orders each month. Supposing that user-generated videos result in a 40% uptick in conversions, your new conversion rate will be 2.8%, which bumps you up to 2,800 orders per month. Just by adding videos, you\u2019ve generated an extra 800 orders. If your average cart value is \u20ac30, you\u2019re generating&nbsp;<strong>an extra \u20ac24,000 in revenue each month thanks to user-generated videos<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-radius: 10px;\" src=\"https:\/\/player.teester.com\/#id=0480effe-552e-4640-8a3a-78a9a526caed\" width=\"700px\" height=\"394px\" frameborder=\"0\" align=\"center\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\"><strong>2 \u2013 Economies of scale in video creation<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"chap2\">These days, everyone knows that <strong>video is the most engaging content<\/strong> marketing format. But very few businesses are investing <a href=\"https:\/\/breadnbeyond.com\/explainer-video\/explainer-video-for-e-learning\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in video marketing<\/a>. Why? Because video production is <strong>costly and time-consuming<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that\u2019s not quite true anymore. The solution we have developed&nbsp;<strong>automates video production<\/strong>&nbsp;thanks to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Direct customer participation in video creation, through a<strong>&nbsp;crowdsourcing<\/strong>&nbsp;process.<\/li><li>A platform that massively&nbsp;<strong>simplifies<\/strong>&nbsp;each stage of the process: identifying the best creator profiles, walking these customers through the video creation process, optimizing the look and feel of the videos, sharing\/posting on product pages and social media, analyzing performance, etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Our partner brands and retailers manage to produce&nbsp;<strong>3x to 100x times more videos on average<\/strong>. One of them, Consobaby, uses user-generated video to engage its community and humanize the shopping experience on its website. By using the Teester platform, the retailer&nbsp;<strong>now generates and shares<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>100 new videos each month&nbsp;<\/strong>on its site and its social media accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\"><strong>3 \u2013 A new source of visibility for your brand<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By sharing the videos on social media, you amplify your content\u2019s reach and visibility. Let\u2019s take one of our clients as an example:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.woodbrass.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Woodbrass<\/a>. The musical instrument retailer decided to post its user-generated videos to YouTube. The result is clear: in 1 year, the user-generated videos generated&nbsp;<strong>290,000 views on the brand\u2019s channel<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the videos are also ranking very well on Google and appearing&nbsp;<strong>at the top of search results for product-related searches<\/strong>. So the web store is getting traffic to its product pages directly from YouTube and Google.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Capture-youtube-woodbrass-1024x531-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-293\" width=\"659\" title=\"Capture youtube woodbrass\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\"><strong>How do you calculate the ROI of user-generated videos in this case?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"chap3\">To calculate the ROI of user-generated videos in terms of increased visibility, it\u2019s pretty simple: one sponsored view on YouTube costs about \u20ac0.20. If like Woodbrass you generate 290,000 organic views,&nbsp;<strong>you are saving 290,000 x 0.20 = \u20ac58,000 on your paid media budget!<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Image-from-Word-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-294\" width=\"650\" title=\"Image from Word 1\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap5\"><strong>4 \u2013 You\u2019ll reduce the number of product returns<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Product returns<\/strong>&nbsp;cost online retailers a lot of money. What leads to product returns?&nbsp;<strong>Dissatisfaction with the product received<\/strong>. This dissatisfaction happens when there is a gap between what the customer expected from the product, or what they imagined they would be getting, and the product they received.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When shopping online, it\u2019s not possible to touch the product or see every aspect of it. Unless they\u2019ve been to see it in-store first (store-to-web), shoppers buy without having tried the product. It\u2019s only logical that this would lead to a higher number of disappointed customers than in-store shopping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge with e-commerce is to reduce this disappointment and the ensuing product returns to a minimum. In an&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/01\/10\/growing-online-sales-means-more-returns-and-trash-for-landfills.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">article published in early 2019<\/a>, CNBC estimated that&nbsp;<strong>40% of online orders are returned<\/strong>. So this is a major issue. Reducing product returns has to be as important a goal as increasing the number of orders!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How can online retailers reduce returns?<\/strong>&nbsp;By optimizing their product pages as much as possible to present the products from&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;<\/em>angles, not just the best ones. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to describe the product and its characteristics in detail and, more importantly, to provide high-quality pictures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we said earlier, videos will take your product pages to a whole new level. User-generated video is the most effective medium for giving shoppers<strong>&nbsp;a clear and accurate idea of the product they\u2019re thinking of buying<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Capture-VSG-Woodbrass-1024x501-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-295\" width=\"650\" title=\"Capture VSG Woodbrass\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap6\"><strong>How do you measure the ROI of user-generated videos when it comes to reducing returns?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"chap4\">Here\u2019s an example. Let\u2019s assume that adding user-generated videos to your product pages&nbsp;<strong>reduces your product returns by 10%<\/strong>. This is a realistic figure. It\u2019s the average we\u2019re seeing with our retail clients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re getting 100,000 orders per year. 30% of these are returned. In other words, you\u2019re processing 30,000 product returns each year. If the average cart value is \u20ac25, product returns represent a loss of \u20ac750,000 (= 30,000 x 25). A 10% drop in returns means you\u2019re reducing the number of returns by 3,000.&nbsp;<strong>That\u2019s a saving of \u20ac75,000 (3,000 x 25).<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there you have it; we hope this article has given you some serious food for thought.
