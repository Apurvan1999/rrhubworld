At the same time, 58% of the customer relationship experts have implemented a strategy and a complete roadmap for AI.<\/p>\n<p>A comparison of the long-term and short-term strategies of these companies represents a significant decline for much less mature companies that have not been able to take advantage of the business intelligence technology that AI offers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Challenges faced by less mature companies<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The study shows that 37% of the least mature companies rely too often on obsolete technologies, especially when it comes to supporting digital channels.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, self-service and automation portals generally lead to frustration among customers and undeniably increase calls to call centers.<\/p>\n<p>Conversely, more mature companies do not encounter this type of problem since they put in place tools to offer a more in-depth customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>Other concerns faced by these lagging companies in terms of customer experience are:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -lack of visibility on user data (37%)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -performance on engagement channels (42%).<\/p>\n<p>This lack of visibility reduces the ability of businesses to quickly resolve issues and provide smoother customer service.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A measurable impact<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For the most mature companies that responded to this survey, 63% of them saw an increase in the net referral rate following the implementation of recent customer engagement strategies and collected an average of 8 points more compared to those companies that have less developed these tools.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, half of these companies experienced an increase in conversation rates.<\/p>\n<p>56% reported an increase in their revenues and 40% saw an increase in order volume.<\/p>\n<p>Agent satisfaction has also increased in these companies. Nearly 50% of them reported an increase in the index of well-being in the workplace.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The AI craze in the customer experience makes it difficult for companies to distinguish what is true or false,&#8221; says Ryan Lester, Senior Director, Customer Engagement at LogMeIn.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The results of this study are indications to help clarify the importance of continuing to evolve customer relationship strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Technologies such as AI create an important competitive advantage for companies and leave some behind, in an irreversible way. &#8220;<\/p>\n<p>Article taken from Co-marketing news<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A study conducted across seven countries including France, reveals that companies that do not invest in artificial intelligence today will have a hard time catching up on customer relations \u2026 LogMeIn has unveiled the results of a new study conducted with Forrester Consulting that establishes the link between the multiple strategies of the customer relationship&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":28,"featured_media":16172,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"post_folder":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.6 -
