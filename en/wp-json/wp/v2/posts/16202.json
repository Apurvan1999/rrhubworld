But just in case I haven&#8217;t convinced you yet, here are the main reasons why you should do it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>It keeps you abreast with what is going on in your sector:<\/strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/key-figures-influencer-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">social networks<\/a> are constantly changing and evolving at an impressive speed.

After listing all the advantages of benchmarking on Instagram, it&#8217;s time for you to get to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">How to analyze the competition on Instagram?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To analyze your main competitors, you have to follow these next simple steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Find your competitors<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing is to locate the Instagram accounts of your competitors: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Search the websites of the competitors that you already know.<\/li><li>Search with keywords related to your sector.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/metricool.com\/how-to-measure-hashtags\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monitor hashtags in your sector.<\/a><\/li><li>Look for influencers in the sector (even if they are not your competition in terms of product, you can learn a lot from these accounts).<\/li><li>It is also interesting to search for organic traffic.

The time has come to get down to work with your benchmark. You have two options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Carry out a manual study where you analyze account by account and write down the data in Excel or word. In this way, you can save this data periodically to compare different periods. <span style=\"color: var(--tertiary-color); letter-spacing: -0.2px;\">This first option is very arduous, and it can take you a long time when analyzing account by account, but don&#8217;t worry, we have an alternative.<\/span><\/li><li>Analyze your competitors with external tools.

Make sure you always analyze the same data so that it makes sense to see the evolution of the accounts.<\/li><li><strong>Look beyond your direct competitors:<\/strong> the world of social media is full of accounts. There are accounts of influencers, digital magazines, or specialized media that can inspire you or help you when creating your strategy, so include them in your analysis.<\/li><li><strong>Analyze your own strategy as well as that of your competition.<\/strong> In this way, you can compare yourself directly with the accounts you analyze and draw conclusions.<\/li><li><strong>Don&#8217;t go crazy with the data. <\/strong>In the digital world, there is data on everything.
