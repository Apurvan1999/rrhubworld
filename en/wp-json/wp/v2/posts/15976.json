Let\u2019s find out.<\/p>\n<h2>#1 You always encourage feedback.<\/h2>\n<p>Customers are already sharing their opinions about you, especially online.<\/p>\n<p>But you know that providing them with internal feedback opportunities is <strong>a safer and more productive way to keep track of what they\u2019re saying.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If they\u2019re talking about you anyway, you might as well hear, learn from, and profit by what they\u2019re saying.<\/p>\n<h2>#2 You\u2019re not afraid to ask.<\/h2>\n<p>Customers will complete your survey if they see it will, in some way, improve their experience.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, 83% of consumers have already completed at least one or, in many cases, three to four feedback surveys in the past 12 months, <strong>with 70% claiming they want to help companies improve.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>#3 Especially younger shoppers.<\/h2>\n<p>Younger customers, in particular, are looking for a superior experience.<\/p>\n<p>64% of Millennial shoppers say they\u2019re <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/why-marketers-need-care-crm-enrichment\/\">more likely to make repeat purchases<\/a> with brands that ask for their opinion.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Therefore, you routinely engage Millennials after a purchase, knowing this is critical to keeping them as customers.<\/p>\n<h2>#4 You minimize obstacles to completion.<\/h2>\n<p>You understand that achieving a 100% survey completion rate is not necessarily a valid goal in and of itself.<\/p>\n<p>A more valid goal is to collect feedback from a representative sample of customers, making sure that <strong>everyone who wants to respond has an equal opportunity to do so<\/strong>, that there is nothing preventing them from sharing their insights.<\/p>\n<h2>#5 And optimize for mobile.<\/h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/68-of-marketers-agree-the-secret-to-customer-feedback-is\/\">68% of marketers use mobile surveys to engage customers<\/a><\/strong> since not doing so means missing out on one of the most effective ways to interact with them.<\/p>\n<p>You understand that for the many Americans mobile <strong>is the primary means of accessing the internet<\/strong>, so not interacting with them via mobile <strong>is a big missed opportunity<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>#6 You remember that less is more.<\/h2>\n<p>More than half of all customers say they will not spend more than three minutes filling out a survey, a possible reason why 80% of them admit to having abandoned a survey halfway through.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You keep customers engaged by asking fewer questions and allowing for shorter responses.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>#7 You ask the right questions.<\/h2>\n<p>You start by asking yourself what you need to know, why, and limit your questions to the absolute essentials.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your goal is to improve business decisions<\/strong> so you only ask questions which <strong>deliver actionable insights to create positive change.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>#8 And avoid leading questions.<\/h2>\n<p>Asking a question like, \u201cHow quickly did we resolve your problem?\u201d assumes you have actually solved the problem.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t assume anything.<\/p>\n<p>Leading questions like this run <strong>the risk of frustrating or even alienating a customer.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At worst, they can seem manipulative and dishonest.<\/p>\n<h2>#9 You use basic but effective metrics like <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/csat-nps-ces-right-metric-for-superior-cx\/\">CSAT, NPS, or CES<\/a>.<\/h2>\n<p>Depending on your need (or needs), you know that any of these metrics will provide <strong>a good starting point for measuring satisfaction.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Whether you want to measure post-transaction happiness, overall customer satisfaction, or identify top reasons for customer dissatisfaction, <strong>one of these is sure to work.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>#10 You show customers their feedback matters.<\/h2>\n<p>Customers probably won\u2019t mind giving you feedback but they do want to see evidence that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.accenture.com\/us-en\/insight-digital-improve-customer-experience\">what they think has actually led to some kind of improvement<\/a> or innovation.<\/p>\n<p>A major customer frustration is <strong>when a company asks for feedback but remains unresponsive to their expressed needs and wants.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>#11 And don\u2019t forget to say thank you.<\/h2>\n<p>You show your appreciation.<\/p>\n<p>They are, after all, <strong>helping you become better at what you do.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>#12 You invest in a good CRM platform.<\/h2>\n<p>Customer relationship management software makes it easier <strong>to track all customer interactions, encourage feedback, and keep all of that information in one place<\/strong>, increasing your ability to provide each customer with a <strong>more relevant, personal experience.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>#13 Because you know you need a good CRM platform.<\/h2>\n<p>Many businesses use, on average, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbespr\/2014\/09\/10\/companies-struggling-to-win-customers-for-life-says-new-study-by-forbes-insights-and-sitecore\/#38e148845759\">35 different data-gathering systems<\/a>, with little to no integration.<\/p>\n<p>Lack of system integration often cripples any efforts <strong>to provide better customer support<\/strong> and, therefore, <strong>stifles the potential benefits customer feedback and data could provide.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>#14 You don\u2019t take customer opinions for granted.<\/h2>\n<p>Customer insight is so important that, as of 2015, an estimated <strong>89% of businesses are competing on customer experience<\/strong>, with customer feedback a crucial component of providing that experience.<\/p>\n<p>Designing a customer experience without their insights increases your chances of delivering an experience which isn\u2019t particularly relevant.<\/p>\n<h2>#15 And one last thing. You can handle the haters.<\/h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, no matter what you do, some customers aren\u2019t going to show you any love.<\/p>\n<p>When you ask for feedback, you realize that you are opening yourself up to every criticism under the sun.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But you stay positive and don\u2019t forget that everyone has had an unhappy customer or two.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Your job is to make sure you have done &#8211; and will continue to do &#8211; everything you can to provide <strong>the best experience to as many customers as possible.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So, do you pass the test?
