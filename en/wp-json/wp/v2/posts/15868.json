Poor survey participation, though usually not as big of a problem as companies anticipate, is still a barrier that prevents groups from getting the feedback that will serve them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This blog post discusses 5 ways that you can <strong>encourage your customers to respond to your surveys and get the data you need to take your customer relations to the next step.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\">1 \u2014 Survey tip: Offer a prize<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of times the issue isn&#8217;t getting your customers to open the survey, it&#8217;s getting them to fill it out all the way through to the &#8220;submit&#8221; button. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.groovehq.com\/blog\/survey-post-mortem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Offering a prize<\/strong> to the customers who complete your survey<\/a> can be an easy and effective way to entice them to complete it to the end. A prize can be something small offered to every customer, like 10% off of their next purchase, or it can be larger gift that you give away in a raffle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/prize-customers-complete-survey.jpg\" alt=\"survey tips\" class=\"wp-image-19365\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You could enter everyone who wins the survey into a contest to win an iPhone, a free product from your brand, even a trip. It doesn&#8217;t have to be something extravagant, just something that shows your audience t<strong>hat you care and that you are willing to invest in a little push to get the survey out there.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">2 \u2014 Survey tip: Choose your email language wisely<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The email that you send out containing your survey is one of the most important emails you will send. The wording, tone, and format you use can be the difference between a great survey result and an empty survey that nobody fills out. Your email should be <strong>short, sweet, and clear, and the tone should be entertaining and informative.<\/strong> A few survey softwares, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/cx-management-en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CX Management<\/a>, include <strong>a direct email integration option<\/strong>, so that when the customer clicks on the email the survey is already there and the customer can immediately start filling out responses. Make sure the email has personalization features <strong>like a signature from someone at your company and the look of a handwritten email <\/strong>(Avoid sending out emails that look like they were automatically created by an app, you know, the ones with size 11 typewriter font that are impersonal and dry. Your customers should feel like there is an actual human behind the ask, someone who wrote the survey and who is waiting for the replies, not a robot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"650\" height=\"703\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-19366 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/myfox-email_0-1.jpg\" alt=\"survey tips\"><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\">3 \u2014 Survey tip: Make it funny<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Using humor to win over an audience is not a new phenomenon, and it&#8217;s a classic because it works. <\/strong>Not taking your survey too seriously by including funny GIFs, a couple of well written, short jokes, or some silly news updates about your team can be a great way to grab readers attention and get them interested in opening up your survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\">4 \u2014 Survey tip: Use Quizzes to gather information<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re concerned that your surveys are not getting the open rate you are looking for, a good option can be to make <strong>the switch to trying quizzes as a way to gather the information you need on your customers. <\/strong>Companies like Hubspot use &#8220;Quizzes&#8221; like the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/29274\/HubSpot-Launches-Free-Marketing-Grader-Tool-to-Replace-Website-Grader.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marketing Grader<\/a> to give their clients great and helpful feedback on their website, and at the same time the quiz questions help them to gather information on their job position, tastes, preferences, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skeepers has recently come out with a quiz that serves a similar purpose called, &#8220;What Type of Marketer are You?&#8221; <\/strong>The quiz is fun, colorful and attractive, and leads with a question about the individual taking the quiz.
