Here\u2019s how.<\/p>\n<h2>1\/ Better understand your target market<\/h2>\n<p>Your business cannot be all things to all customers. Instead, you must reach out to specific customers whose needs you are best prepared to meet. Data will help you identify who those customers are and how you can align your products or services to their needs.\u00a0 When you know who your most valuable customers are, you are in a better position to send personalized marketing emails which see, <strong>on average, a <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.business2community.com\/small-business\/6-pillars-achieving-email-marketing-success-small-business-01212937\"><strong>119% greater click-through rate<\/strong><\/a><strong> than \u201c<em>business-as-usual<\/em>\u201d mass marketing emails<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>2\/ Solve customer problems more efficiently<\/h2>\n<p><strong>High-performing companies are <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amanet.org\/training\/articles\/Companies-See-Need-to-Build-Analytical-Skills-in-Their-Organizations.aspx\"><strong>2.5 times more likely to regularly collect customer data<\/strong><\/a><strong> in order to ensure the smoothest possible customer journey<\/strong> and, therefore, ensure higher levels of customer satisfaction. When a business proactively delivers customer care, they establish a clear point of differentiation that reinforces the company\u2019s brand identity and provides greater customer value.<\/p>\n<h2>3\/ Improve your customer service<\/h2>\n<p>According to an <a href=\"http:\/\/about.americanexpress.com\/news\/pr\/2011\/csbar.aspx\">American Express survey<\/a>, <strong>78% of customers have bailed on a transaction or not made an intended purchase because of a poor customer service experience<\/strong>. If you can use data to identify early on common friction points in your experience, you can fix underlying problems, increasing your customer retention levels.<\/p>\n<h2>4\/ Ensure greater customer loyalty<\/h2>\n<p><strong>More than half of the annual revenue for <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress-src.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BiaMantaKelsey-SBloyalty.pdf\"><strong>61% of small business owners comes from repeat customers<\/strong><\/a>. Considering the importance of loyal customers, businesses increasingly turn to customer data to provide a high-level of customer service which ensures customers have no reason to leave them for a competitor. With information at hand concerning your customers\u2019 demographic profiles, transaction histories, and preferred channels, you will be better positioned to offer an experience no competitor can touch.<\/p>\n<h2>5\/ Make post-purchase recommendations<\/h2>\n<p>To have more loyal customers and maintain brand loyalty, you must engage your customers post-purchase. \u00a0One way to do this is via cross-selling and up-selling, <strong>offering customers related or similar but higher-end products which are, according to <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/conversionxl.com\/upselling-techniques\/\"><strong>one study<\/strong><\/a><strong>, responsible for an average of 10-30% of ecommerce revenues<\/strong>. Data will enable you to provide your customers with relevant offers, making it easier for them to work with you.<\/p>\n<p>For all of these reasons, it\u2019s no wonder why so many businesses are obsessed with gathering customer data. The ability to connect with customers on a whole new level increases your chances of selling to the right customers, simplifies every customer interaction, and ensures you are maintaining strong brand loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>We live in a data-obsessed age, where even the tiniest insights into consumers can yield huge results for ecommerce businesses. Consequently, <strong>you should access available customer data, and learn to use it in the most effective way<\/strong>. To see the greatest results, you, too, must make data an essential part of your day-to-day business operations.<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-137a38ec-95db-41fc-856f-f339ec9de8e9\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-137a38ec-95db-41fc-856f-f339ec9de8e9\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-137a38ec-95db-41fc-856f-f339ec9de8e9\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--> <a href=\"http:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/137a38ec-95db-41fc-856f-f339ec9de8e9\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-137a38ec-95db-41fc-856f-f339ec9de8e9\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/137a38ec-95db-41fc-856f-f339ec9de8e9-1.png\" alt=\"download my free ecommerce kpis guide\" \/><\/a> <\/span> <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n\n        hbspt.cta.load(744484, '137a38ec-95db-41fc-856f-f339ec9de8e9', {});\n    \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span> <!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For an online business to succeed today, it cannot just be customer-centric; it must be customer-obsessed.
