TikTok beats out LinkedIn, Reddit, Pinterest, Snapchat, and Twitter for <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/tiktok-advertising\/\">monthly active users<\/a>, who spend an average of <a href=\"https:\/\/adage.com\/article\/tech\/leaked-pitch-deck-reveals-how-tiktok-trying-woo-brands\/2205906\">46 minutes per day<\/a> on the platform.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok currently offers four main forms of sponsored ads for brands, which is how most companies are advertising on the platform. Brands also have the option to scout for TikTok influencers on their own. To help your brand navigate TikTok advertising, we\u2019ve explained each advertising option as well as TikTok ad format best practices.<\/p>\n<p>In-feed native ads<\/p>\n<p>Native ads are randomly sprinkled within a user\u2019s For You feed. The most successful native ads are the ones that blend the most seamlessly with the rest of the organic content in the For You feed (i.e. it takes more than a split second for users to realize they\u2019re viewing an ad). In-feed ads can drive traffic to your brand\u2019s TikTok profile page or to an external link. TikTok users can engage with your ad just like an organic post by leaving likes and comments. <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/homepage\/inspiration\/2\">Maybelline recently ran in-feed TikTok ads<\/a> to promote the launch of their Hyper Curl mascara. After just one day, the ad amassed 48,700 likes and 709 reshares, resulting in an 80% increase in brand awareness and a 47.97% increase in brand favorability.<\/p>\n<p>Hashtag challenges<\/p>\n<p>Thought hashtag challenges were strictly organic? Any brand can create a hashtag challenge and boost it through TikTok\u2019s advertiser platform. Most branded challenges involve a specific sound bite along with a set of coordinated movements. Challenges are best when they\u2019re easy to replicate. Brands from all different verticals have advertised on TikTok this way, from <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/homepage\/inspiration\/1\">Clean &amp; Clear<\/a>\u00a0and NYX to <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.tiktok.com\/en-us\/tiktok-touches-down-on-super-bowl-liv\">TurboTax<\/a>. To kick-off a hashtag challenge, brands employ relevant TikTok influencers to film videos that demonstrate the challenge in order to catapult it into virality.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to seeing hashtag challenge videos appear in their For You feed, users can see sponsored hashtag challenges appear on the banner in their Discovery tab. Users can click on the banner to see a full explanation of the challenge and all the videos that have been created using the challenge\u2019s hashtag. TikTok charges brands an additional fee to feature your challenge on the Discovery tab banner.<\/p>\n<p>Brand takeover<\/p>\n<p>Brand takeovers are special ads that appear when a user first opens their TikTok app. These ads will appear on screen before users can view any organic content in their For You feed. TikTok limits brand takeovers to one brand per category per day, which means on any given day, only one beauty brand\u2019s ad will run, only one fashion brand\u2019s ad will run, and so forth. A takeover can be a still image, a video, or a GIF, and can drive to an external landing page or a hashtag challenge page within the app.<\/p>\n<p>Branded lenses and filters<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar to AR (Augmented Reality) lenses and filters for Snapchat and Instagram Stories, brands can also create original lenses and filters for TikTok. These are most commonly used to promote new product launches. Branded lenses and filters can go live for up to 10 days. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/what-is-tiktok\/\">64% of TikTok users<\/a> have tried branded lenses or filters.<\/p>\n<p>How to advertise on TikTok without TikTok\u2019s ad platform<\/p>\n<p>Not sure if you want to utilize any of the official advertising capabilities that TikTok offers? There may be another way to step away from traditional advertisements and opt into a new era of influencer marketing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TikTok influencers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Brands use TikTok macro-influencers for sponsored hashtag challenges, but just like any other social media platform, brands can hire influencers to create any other content that feels natural, fun, and relevant. Brands like Target and Red Bull have already started working with TikTok influencers to create sponsored videos.<\/p>\n<p>While TikTok may be a newer platform for brands to work with influencers on, the basic principles for creating excellent sponsored content remain the same:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to scout for influencers who have an audience similar to your own or the one you\u2019re trying to target. That way, your product or brand will have a much better chance of resonating<\/li>\n<li>Find influencers who really know their audience inside and out. Scope out engagement rates, view counts, and other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.octoly.com\/blog\/a-guide-to-tiktok-marketing-for-brands-7-tiktok-metrics-you-should-be-tracking\/\">key metrics<\/a> to get a better idea of how attuned an influencer is with their audience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>TikTok advertising specs and best practices<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re working with influencers or creating your own sponsored videos for TikTok\u2019s advertising platform, you\u2019ll want to review the guidelines for specs and best practices before filming and editing.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Your TikTok ad should have:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 9:16 aspect ratio (this is the same aspect ratio as Instagram Stories)<\/li>\n<li>A resolution greater than 720 x 1080<\/li>\n<li>A length of 9 to 15 seconds (with the exception of Brand Takeovers, which must be 3-5 seconds long)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Request a Demo<\/h2>\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_6  et_pb_text_align_justified et_pb_bg_layout_light\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Octoly makes it easy for brands to build authentic text reviews and amazing influencer content with product seeding campaigns at scale.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Related Articles<\/h2>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While TikTok is still considered the wild west of social media, it\u2019s proving to be the next frontier for brands and influencers alike.
