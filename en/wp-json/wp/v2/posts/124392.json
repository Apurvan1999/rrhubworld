But there\u2019s a very important difference between potential reach and actual reach that you should know before you start taking any steps to target increased reach. <strong>Potential reach<\/strong> is your total number of followers &#8212; the base that have clicked the follow button. That\u2019s it. <strong>Actual<\/strong> <strong>reach <\/strong>is how many unique accounts viewed your content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Both of these you can view on your account by checking your follower count and reach in your analytics section. Actual reach is also different from <strong>impressions<\/strong>, which is data that Instagram provides each user as well. Impressions is a measurement of how many times a post of yours was shown to your followers based on Instagram\u2019s algorithm. What you want to focus on is actual reach and how to heighten it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Why is reach important?<\/p>\n<p><span>Improving your reach is extremely crucial to expanding on brand awareness, as well as bringing in new eyes on your posts, campaigns and products. It\u2019s important for your actual reach to be high in numbers but also diverse and have an audience that also engages and interacts with your content; i.e. commenting, liking, etc. Analyzing and knowing what your reach is and how to use it to your advantage with influencer marketing is important, because it can help you learn more about your audience, which posts are doing well and which are simply causing people to scroll past. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In addition, when it comes to promoting a product or campaign, you want it for your reach to lead to more <strong>engagement. <\/strong>Engagement on your posts goes beyond reach &#8212;\u00a0 it refers to your content being interacted by an audience, through reposts, likes, mentions and so on. Ultimately, this creates a more authentic connection with the target audience and slowly helps steadily a follower base. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>How to measure reach<\/p>\n<p><span>Okay, we know what reach is, now how do we quantify it? Instagram does the handy work of documenting most of this information for you through the <strong>Analytics or Insights<\/strong> tabs. If you&#8217;re working with different influencers for a campaign or product launch, it could be a good idea to see how many impressions they&#8217;re getting on each account. Each post will be different, so it\u2019s a good idea to analyze each of the posts separately as well as seeing your overall impressions. <\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>You can view your data from your insights through your main page as well to see how your posts have done.\u00a0 It will give you a number of how many accounts that post reached, as well as a percentage of how many of those accounts weren\u2019t following you. This not only shows you how many people saw your post, but how many could be potential future followers as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Now this is where it gets really specific, you can actually view your impressions as well as see what the source is from those impressions. Specifically when working with influencers, this can be different depending on their type of content and follower base. Some may have more impressions coming from specific hashtags they have, and some might be coming through their profile, the home page or other sources. After you learn what is helping bring in more unique visitors, you can use that when crafting your influencer campaign, such as using a specific hashtag to bring in followers from a different audience. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Request a Demo<\/h2>\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_6  et_pb_text_align_justified et_pb_bg_layout_light\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>Octoly makes it easy for brands to build authentic text reviews and amazing influencer content with product seeding campaigns at scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Related Articles<\/h2>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Before embarking on any kind of influencer campaign, it\u2019s important to learn an influencer\u2019s potential and actual reach on their accounts to learn what audience is most drawn to their pages and what kind of content can make the biggest impression.
