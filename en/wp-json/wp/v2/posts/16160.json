Improve customer knowledge<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not a day goes by without hearing the word &#8220;omnichannel&#8221;. The term has become the leitmotiv of all marketing and digital departments. But if the implementation of a real omnichannel strategy is a major issue, achieving this goal is only possible through in depth knowledge of&nbsp; the activity of its customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the reconciliation of online behavioral data and offline CRM data, the Predictive Marketing Activation platform makes it possible to obtain an increased knowledge of the shopping journey of its customers, and thus know journey preparation time, the number of visits on the website before making appointments in an agency etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By providing RFM segmentation of your database, Predictive Marketing Activation allows you to know the value of your customers and identify strategic segments within your CRM database. Identifying these segments will then help you determine which marketing activations are the most value-generating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\"><strong>2. Acquisition: Generate qualified traffic websites<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many travel agency groups spend a substantial budget on acquisition, without differentiating campaigns based on the value of their future customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By capitalizing on customer data, Predictive Marketing Activation makes it possible to recruit duplicates of its best customers or identified priority segments, as well as to exclude known and existing customers from campaigns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By identifying a reconciled customer on Google, Predictive Marketing Activation offers the ability to adjust bids based on the customer&#8217;s membership of a segment, and to customize the Adwords depending on when a customer expresses its needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\"><strong>3. Detect prospects with high potential<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When we know that more than 80% of French people prepare their trips online, it seems essential for travel agencies, to detect and qualify customers presenting purchase intention visiting their site to optimize their transformation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of its ability to analyze hot browsing data, Predictive Marketing Activation is able to evaluate a consumer&#8217;s appetency for a product via a scoring model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sala\u00fcn Holidays example: working with the Predictive Marketing Activation platform, Sala\u00fcn Holidays can focus its marketing efforts on &#8220;hot&#8221; prospects and increase ROI of its actions. For example, every morning Sala\u00fcn agencies receive a list of hot prospects to contact by phone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\"><strong>4. Build brand loyalty and increase your repurchase rate<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main challenges of any company operating in a competitive sector such as travel, is to retain customers, while maintaining its image.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the Predictive Marketing Activation platform, you will now be able to customize your on-site and digital communication in real time, taking into account the purchasing history of your customers.
