Don\u2019t forget that more than 93% of consumers read customer reviews before buying a product.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies show that consumers who read customer reviews also read the brands\u2019 responses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we\u2019re going to share our golden rules for responding to satisfied customer reviews.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you\u2019ll soon find out, it\u2019s not just about being polite\u2026 You can turn responses to positive reviews into powerful marketing levers!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\"><strong>1 \u2013 Thank Customers who Leave Positive Customer Reviews<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All responses to positive customer reviews should include a \u201cthank you.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that customers who leave glowing reviews have no obligation to do so and are a minority. Thanking them for their contribution is the least you can do. Any response should begin this way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also recommend making your thank you post public. You may be thanking the customer who left the review, but it will be read by hundreds, thousands, even tens of thousands other consumers during their buying journey.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few examples:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Thank you for your feedback!&nbsp;<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Our priority is to make our customers happy. Thank you so much for your feedback!&nbsp;<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>We love getting feedback from our customers. Thank you for sharing.<\/em>&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Thank you for sharing your experience. We\u2019re delighted to hear that you like our product. Thanks again and see you soon.&nbsp;<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Thank you for taking the time to post a comment.&nbsp;<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\"><strong>2 \u2013 Personalize Your Responses<\/strong>&nbsp;to your Customer Reviews<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer reviews: let\u2019s go one step further\u2026&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want your response to have an even greater impact, we recommend personalizing it. A study shows that 65% of customers dislike generic responses (Source: Barom\u00e8tre Qualiweb 2021).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that personalizing your responses is easy. You can even partly automate the process by using personalization variables.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are lots of way to personalize a response. They all require good customer knowledge\u2026 and tools.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verified-reviews.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Verified Reviews<\/a> collection platform enables you to connect to different sources of data: CRM, transactional, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the different personalization elements that you can add to your answers with our platform:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer\u2019s first and last name.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Order reference if the purchase was made online.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Late of purchase.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last two personalization variables are useful when handling mixed customer reviews or requests. Whereas the first, the customer\u2019s first and last name, can be used in all your responses, whether to positive or negative reviews.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the &#8220;thank you\u201d examples above can be personalized with the customer\u2019s name. For example: \u201c{First Name}, <em>thank you for your feedback!<\/em>\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\"><strong>3 \u2013 Humanize Your Responses to you Customer Reviews by Signing Off<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers like responses to be signed by the person who wrote them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It adds a human touch to your message and boosts its emotional impact. Personalized signatures foster trust and reassurance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our previous example would go something like this:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c{First Name}, thank you for your feedback! Lisa, {brand name} Customer Advisor&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also respond to customers on behalf of the entire team.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<em>Have a great day, on behalf of the entire team. Yasmine, <\/em>{brand} <em>Community Manager<\/em>\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<em>On behalf of everyone at <\/em>{brand},<em> have a great weekend. Victoria, Community Manager<\/em>\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Signed response to a customer review&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\"><strong>4 \u2013 Pay Attention to the Form<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Form is almost just as important as content. A response full of spelling and grammar mistakes will be much less impactful.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most customers pay attention to the quality of the writing and the style. We recommend using a spell and syntax checker to identify and quickly correct any mistakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for writing style, it all depends on your brand DNA and target customers. A young, trendy brand shouldn\u2019t use the same tone as a corporate organization.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is one simple golden rule, whatever the brand: \u201cBe polite and professional.\u201d It is a sign of respect.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are 2 very different responses that both work if they match with your brand DNA and customers:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Thank you for your message,<\/em> {First name}<em>. We love getting positive feedback from our customers. We look forward to seeing you again soon! Leah&nbsp;<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Thank you for your message,<\/em> {Title} {Last name}<em>.

Don\u2019t forget that your responses are public and will be read by lots of customers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are 4 examples of responses to a customer review that highlight the brand and its products:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us, <\/em>{First name}<em>.

You start off by thanking them, of course. But why not inform them of your other services or special offers?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are 4 examples of responses to positive customer reviews that highlight your services or special offers and encourage them to shop with you again:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Thank you for your message, <\/em>{First name}<em>.
