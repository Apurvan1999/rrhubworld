It will therefore<strong> optimize its ROI by avoiding offering a markdown<\/strong> to an individual who could have bought the product at the initial price.<\/p>\n<p>By analyzing the CRM profile and the transactional history of each customer, artificial intelligence <strong>highlights the appropriate pretenses to solicit the customer and selects the ideal product to offer the customer in order to make him\/her react.<\/strong> The learning machine helps to <strong>build a complete customer DNA<\/strong>, directly operational <strong>to optimise campaign targeting, boost the impact of their content and increase the value they generate.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Individualized marketing,<\/strong> made accessible to retailers today thanks to the capabilities of artificial intelligence, can really enable retailers to calmly apprehend the recovery by <strong>preparing relevant personalized strategies that will enable them to get back in touch with their consumers as quickly as possible and with a viable, sustainable ROI.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Faced with the impact of the Coronavirus outbreak and isolation on their business, retailers are getting organized, with a view to recovery.
