This classic targeting method has been used for decades.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span lang=\"FR\">Over the past few years, a more modern approach has emerged:<strong> highly targeted surveys.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span lang=\"FR\">So, what is a filter question? What are its limits? In what way are ultra-targeted surveys a modern alternative? Read on to find out.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span lang=\"FR\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\"><span lang=\"FR\">What is a Filter Question? [Definition]<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span lang=\"FR\">As the name suggests, a filter question is a question that aims to filter survey respondents. This age-old process is also used to target survey and customer\/marketing study respondents.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"two-examples-of-filter-questions\"><span lang=\"FR\">Two Examples of Filter Questions<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><p><span lang=\"FR\">Let\u2019s take an example to illustrate how a filter question works: \u201cAre you a home-owner?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-22369\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-care.jpg\" alt=\"customer surveys\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the answer, you can redirect the respondent to the questions that apply to them. For example, you could divide the next questions into two groups:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Questions 2 to 6 apply to home-owners.<\/span><\/li><li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Questions 7 to 10 apply to tenants.<\/span><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Respondents who answer \u201cYes\u201d to the first question will be asked to answer questions 2 to 6, whereas the respondents who answer \u201cNo\u201d will be rerouted to questions 7 to 10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><p>Let\u2019s take another example: \u201cAre you interested in [name of a service or product]?\u201d. If the survey is about that particular product or service and the respondent answers \u201cNo\u201d, then they are redirected to a thank you page, as the survey does not apply to them. Only those who answer \u201cYes\u201d are rerouted to the next part of the survey.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-22370\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-management.jpg\" alt=\"filter questions\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>If the survey is deployed on the Internet, this rerouting can be automatic. For example, the Skeepers&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/cx-management-en\/\">CX Management<\/a>&nbsp;solution allows to configure confidentiality rules so as to personalise the questions according to the answers given to previous questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filter-questions-a-classic-solution-to-target-survey-respondents\">Filter Questions, a Classic Solution to Target Survey Respondents<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The filter question method is a classic way to target respondents in customer\/marketing studies and surveys. Filter questions ensure that you only ask respondents questions that apply to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><p>If the survey is administered in a paper format, the respondent is instructed to skip to the questions that apply to them. If the survey is online, only the filtered questions are displayed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">The Modern Alternative to Filter Questions: Highly Targeted Surveys<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filter-questions-are-based-on-post-hoc-targeting\">Filter Questions are Based on Post-Hoc Targeting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Filter questions allow to target respondents within a survey. When a respondent starts a survey, the filter question either:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Redirects them to the applicable questions.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Or invites them to \u201cexit\u201d the survey if they are not the target audience.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\n\n\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The sorting and filtering process takes place after the survey or study has been deployed. Which is the main disadvantage of classic filter questions. As a result, surveys or studies are sent to respondents who don\u2019t fit the target, which can:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\n\n\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Impact the quality of collected answers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Irritate certain respondents.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Increase study or survey costs.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But today, there is an alternative to filter questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"highly-targeted-surveys\">Highly Targeted Surveys<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This alternative takes the form of highly targeted surveys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A highly targeted survey is a survey that is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Designed for a specific target audience that is qualified beforehand and includes precise questions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-22371\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-purchase.jpg\" alt=\"filter questions\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><span lang=\"FR\"><strong>Highly targeted surveys<\/strong> tend to be short because all the questions apply to the target respondent. This is a huge advantage compared to classic surveys based on filter questions, simply because short surveys have a better&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2384218\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">response rate<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span lang=\"FR\">Highly targeted surveys are designed, in theory, with a specific target audience in mind. This differentiates them from mass surveys that filter respondents with contingency questions. As mentioned above, the filter method leads to potentially non-relevant respondents receiving the survey and to targeting after deployment. Whereas a highly targeted survey targets its audience before deployment.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span lang=\"FR\">Highly targeted surveys have another characteristic: they are \u201csmart\u201d. This means that they are triggered at the right time in the customer journey, based on customer behaviour (triggers), and that they are personalised with customer data <strong>(mainly CRM).<\/strong> Which means that filter questions are no longer necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span lang=\"FR\">For all these reasons, highly targeted surveys are slowly replacing classic filter question surveys. We hope to have convinced you of the benefits of this modern approach!<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\" id=\"hs-cta-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/20304540\/cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" height=\"159\" width=\"700\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a.png\" alt=\"Discover our Solutions: Book your Demo\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(20304540, 'cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a', {\"useNewLoader\":\"true\",\"region\":\"na1\"}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Filter questions, otherwise known as contingency questions, are used in studies and surveys to target respondents and route them to questions that apply to them.
