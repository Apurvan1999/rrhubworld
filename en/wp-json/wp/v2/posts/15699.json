Which is why it is important to fully <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/redesign-customer-journey\/\">optimise this journey<\/a>.<br \/>\nThe most effective solution is to ask your customers and website users for feedback via <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/cx-management-en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customer surveys<\/a>. Here are 12 questions to ask in order to optimise your website and customer journey.<\/p>\n<h2>An E-Commerce Buyer\u2019s Journey and its Importance<\/h2>\n<p>The buyer\u2019s journey on an e-commerce website simply refers to the path taken by a user, from arriving on the site, via a search engine for example, to completing an order. The buyer\u2019s journey can also be defined as all the steps taken by an Internet user\/customer from getting ready to buy (browsing online catalogue) to completing an order (payment). This is also known as the customer journey.One of the biggest concerns of any online retailer is shopping cart abandonment. Retailers are always striving to <a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/methods-for-killing-shopping-cart-abandonment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reduce their cart abandonment rate<\/a> as much as possible. As we\u2019ve seen in a previous article, the cart abandonment rate determines a retailer\u2019s conversion rate in e-commerce.<br \/>\nIt is proven that a poor buyer\u2019s journey increases the percentage of abandoned carts. To transform these users into buyers, it is therefore essential to optimise the buyer\u2019s journey on your e-commerce website. This journey is essential because it determines in part your online store\u2019s performance.<\/p>\n<h2>The Different Steps of the Buyer\u2019s Journey<\/h2>\n<p>In e-commerce, the buyer\u2019s journey varies from one website to another, but it always involves the same key stages. In chronological order:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The user arrives on your website.<\/li>\n<li>They use the menu and categories to browse your catalogue.<\/li>\n<li>They click on product pages.<\/li>\n<li>They add the products they\u2019re interested in buying to the basket \u2013 via an add to basket button.<\/li>\n<li>The customer places an order, with or without signing in (customer account).<\/li>\n<li>They select a delivery method from the available options.<\/li>\n<li>They chose a payment method from the available options.<\/li>\n<li>They confirm their order and proceed to payment (e.g., by entering their bank details).<\/li>\n<li>They receive a confirmation email. This last step is, strictly speaking, no longer part of the buyer\u2019s journey.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is a simplified overview of the customer journey when buying a product from an online store. As mentioned above, the quality of the buyer\u2019s journey is essential. If the journey is too long, with repetitive steps (in particular asking for the same information several times), too complex or not reassuring enough for the buyer, then they may abandon their basket. There is a simple solution for this; ask your customers what they think.<\/p>\n<h2>Questions to Ask Customers to Improve your Online Buyer\u2019s Journey<\/h2>\n<p>Your buyer\u2019s journey should be well-designed. But it\u2019s not always easy to know whether a buyer\u2019s journey is qualitative or not, even if there are good practices in this respect. And what matters most is that your customers and visitors enjoy shopping on your website.<\/p>\n<p>You need to adopt a customer-centric approach. Subjective factors (customer satisfaction) are more important than objective factors. Which is why it is so important to ask your customers what they think about your e-commerce site and, more specifically, your buyer\u2019s journey.<\/p>\n<h3>Here are 12 examples of questions to ask your customers, to improve your buyer\u2019s or customer journey:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Is it easy to find what you\u2019re looking for in the categories?<\/li>\n<li>Are the product pages detailed enough?<\/li>\n<li>Did you have any problems adding a product to your basket?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you mind signing in to place an order?<\/li>\n<li>Are there enough delivery options?<\/li>\n<li>Which delivery mode do you prefer?<\/li>\n<li>How would you rate our delivery costs?<\/li>\n<li>Do you mind PayPal being our only payment option?<\/li>\n<li>Do we offer enough payment options?<\/li>\n<li>Is our order review page clear?<\/li>\n<li>Do you think our buyer\u2019s journey is easy?<\/li>\n<li>How would you improve our buyer\u2019s journey?&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are just examples, of course, and need to be adapted to your company goals. Depending on the results, you should prioritise optimisation actions to be undertaken. Don\u2019t forget that the buyer\u2019s journey is only one element \u2013 albeit a very important one \u2013 that determines your user experience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>12 Questions to Improve your E-Commerce Buyer\u2019s Journey September 2, 2021 \u00a0 12 Questions to Improve your E-Commerce Buyer\u2019s Journey September 2, 2021 The simplicity, security and quality of your buyer\u2019s journey determines, in part, your e-commerce website\u2019s performance, i.e., its conversion rate.
