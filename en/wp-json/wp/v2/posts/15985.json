We will then take a look at the best practices to put in place a successful Voice of the Customer programme. You will find out how and why surveys are precious tools for understanding post-Covid buying habits and customer expectations.<\/p>\n<p>This article is a summary of our last webinar with Aurore Beugniez, co-founder &amp; COO of MyFeelBack, Eric Vibert, MyFeelBack Head of Customer Success, Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Leroux, Partner \u2013 Digital &amp; Customer KPMG, and finally Valentin Collet, KPMG senior consultant. We would like to thank them for taking part and the quality of their discussions.<\/p>\n<h2>How the customer relationship and experience have changed post-Covid<\/h2>\n<p>In June 2020, KPMG conducted a large study with 12,000 consumers in 12 countries to understand the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the customer experience: <a href=\"https:\/\/home.kpmg\/xx\/en\/home\/insights\/2020\/06\/consumers-and-the-new-reality.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KPMG Global Customer Analysis \u2013 June 2020<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As you will see, the health and economic crisis has brought about significant changes in customer buying motivations, trust in brands or preferred channels\u2026<\/p>\n<h3>The 3 main trends highlighted by KPMG\u2019s study<\/h3>\n<p>A new consumer profile has emerged since the Covid-19 crisis began. This consumer has three characteristics:<\/p>\n<h4>1\u00a0\u2014 Price sensitivity<\/h4>\n<p>The study shows that consumer price sensitivity has increased to varying degrees depending on the country. Price sensitivity is at its strongest in countries that provided households with little financial assistance, such as Italy. In countries where measures were implemented to support households (furlough for example), price sensitivity has not increased to the same extent.<\/p>\n<h4>2\u00a0\u2014 The digitalisation of the customer journey<\/h4>\n<p>The Covid-19 crisis and lockdowns have led to a digitalisation of the customer journey, customer relationship and, more generally, the customer experience. Consumers have had to become familiar with digital channels and\/or increase their use. This is particularly notable in the retail industry for example, where online channels have momentarily replaced offline channels.<\/p>\n<h4>3\u00a0\u2014 Responsible consumers<\/h4>\n<p>The Covid-19 crisis has developed consumer awareness of the social and societal consequences of their consumption. More and more consumers want to consume in a more ethical, responsible and environmentally friendly manner.<\/p>\n<h3>\u201cThese trends are accelerating\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>These three trends are shaping a new consumer profile and <strong>new customer experience expectations.<\/strong> But as Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Leroux pointed out during the webinar, the Covid-19 crisis has accelerated trends that were already emerging before the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>Consumer financial constraints due to a drop in purchasing power, the digitalisation of the customer journey and experience, a rise in economic and social awareness\u2026 All these trends have been around for several years.<\/p>\n<h3>The most important factors in the buying decision<\/h3>\n<p>What are the key factors in the buying decision? What plays an important role in the act of buying in the post-Covid era? The study conducted out by KPMG provides answers to these questions.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the 13 main factors in the buying decision:<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 453px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tendances-experience-client.jpg\" alt=\"Main factors for buying decision\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Credit: KPMG Global Customer Analysis \u2013 June 2020<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Value for money <\/strong>is the first. 63% of consumers say this is a key purchasing criteria. The Covid-19 crisis, and its social and economic impact, has further increased this factor. But it is important not to focus solely on this factor.<\/p>\n<p>The 2nd and 3rd factors are a reminder that brand experience still plays a key role in the buying decision:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ease of buying, i.e. the buying experience<\/strong>, seamlessness and quality of the purchasing journey, is important for 42% of respondents.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Trust in the brand<\/strong> is important for 41% of consumers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Consumers are looking for good value, but also a quality experience. It\u2019s not all about the price. We agree with this analysis.<\/p>\n<h3>Focus on digital customer relationship trends<\/h3>\n<p>As explained above, one of the main trends that has been reinforced by the Covid-19 crisis is the digitalisation of the customer journey and consumers\u2019 increasing use of digital channels, whether to buy a product or contact a company. Let\u2019s take a moment to explore this strategic point further.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 469px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tendances-relation-client-stat.jpg\" alt=\"Digital customer relationships trends\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><strong>Graph A.<\/strong>\u00a0<em>Credit:\u00a0KPMG Global Customer Analysis \u2013 June 2020<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Graph A shows how consumer behaviour has changed before and after Covid-19. There is a clear drop in physical (in-store visits) and traditional (telephone) channels, as well as <strong>an increase in the use of digital channels<\/strong> \u2013 websites, phone apps, email, online communities \/ forums, messaging apps, social media, video calls, etc.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 413px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tendances-relation-client-statistique.jpg\" alt=\"Customers experience trends\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><strong>Graph B.<\/strong>\u00a0<em>Credit:\u00a0KPMG Global Customer Analysis \u2013 June 2020<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Graph B shows that buying factors that have been strengthened by the Covid-19 crisis \u2013 personal safety, but also the importance of buying local, social and economic awareness, people policy and brand values. These changes are the most obvious among 18 to 44 year olds, as well as over 45s.<\/p>\n<p>Customer requests, expectations and priorities have also changed following the Covid-19 crisis. It is important for companies to adapt and rethink their promise in terms of products, services and experience. How? By implementing a Voice of the Customer programme, based on the collection and activation of customer feedback.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Discover our article <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/customer-relationship-during-crisis\/\">Customer Relationship Management During a Crisis \u2013 Advice &amp; Best Practices<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>The keys for a successful Voice of the Customer programme<\/h2>\n<p>You need to adapt to new customer expectations in general but also, and above all, to YOUR customers\u2019 new expectations. You can only do this if you know your customers, listen to them, give them a voice, and analyse their expectations. Which is why managing feedback is key. Over the past few years, we have observed a renewed interest in the Voice of the Customer. This is an increasingly strategic issue for companies.<\/p>\n<p>Your company must have the tools and be organised. A successful programme is based on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Collecting customer feedback.<\/li>\n<li>Activating customer feedback.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 474px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/enrich-crm-customer-data.jpg\" alt=\"Enrich your CRM with customer data\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We will now take a look at the best techniques for collecting and activating feedback.<\/p>\n<h3>Targeted and personalised customer surveys<\/h3>\n<p>The best way to collect customer feedback is to send your customers surveys.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Important<\/strong>: your surveys should be targeted.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to accurately target your customers by sending surveys at the right time.<\/p>\n<p>Asking for feedback once, twice or three times a year is no longer enough. Today, the best practice is <strong>to contact your customers for feedback immediately<\/strong>, i.e. right after an interaction or stage of their journey that you want to rate \u2013 an in-store purchase, an online order, an exchange with customer services, etc. Targeting allows to increase customer survey response rates and the number of answers collected.<\/p>\n<p>But targeting is not just about timing (sending survey straight away), it is also about channels. It is important to deploy your surveys on channels that your customers use. <strong>A targeted survey is a message sent at the right time, to the right person, on the right channel.<\/strong> At MyFeelBack, we take a multichannel approach. We have enriched our solution so that your company can deploy surveys via your customers\u2019 preferred channels \u2013 email, website, social media, instant messaging, chatbot, etc.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Secondly:\u00a0<\/strong>your surveys should be personalised<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Your surveys should be personalised depending on the customer and stage of the journey.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 695px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/leading-question-survey.png\" alt=\"Customer survey customisation\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Personalisation has become firmly rooted in marketing culture. Today, most emails are personalised. This has become standard. But personalisation is still rare when it comes to customer surveys. This can mainly be explained by technology. Until recently, few technologies allowed to personalise surveys. This is no longer the case. MyFeelBack\u2019s solution offers a high level of customer survey personalisation.<\/p>\n<p>Targeting and personalisation are therefore two key ingredients for successful feedback collection.<\/p>\n<h3>Transforming customer feedback into actions<\/h3>\n<p>The second area to deal with is activating feedback. How can you activate the answers you collect? How can you transform customer feedback into actions and business value for your company?<\/p>\n<p>Les feedbacks ont deux principaux usages. Ils g\u00e9n\u00e8rent de la valeur business \u00e0 deux niveaux\u00a0: un niveau indirect et un niveau direct.<\/p>\n<p>Feedback has two main uses. It generates business value at two levels \u2013 an indirect level and a direct level.<\/p>\n<p><em>The indirect value of feedback \u2013 reporting and analysis<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Survey answers can be <strong>analysed statistically<\/strong>. Aggregating and cross-referencing answers will help you identify weaknesses and areas for improvement within your organisation, management and working methods. Data from your survey can be fed into your reports and dashboards, and then shared with your employees.<\/p>\n<p>For your reports to be real decision-making aids, it is essential to build your dashboards with <strong>highly operational indicators<\/strong>. For example, there is not much point in adding an overall satisfaction score to a report for operational teams. This score is too general and will be difficult to act on in the field. On the other hand, it is useful and interesting to cross-reference a satisfaction score with: a stage of the customer journey, a geographical area, a customer type, a product or product range, etc. This will provide you with tangible indicators that your operational teams can use in the field.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 616px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/dashboard-nps-en.jpg\" alt=\"Customer satisfaction dashboard\" \/><\/p>\n<p><em>The direct value of feedback \u2013 individual customer care<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Customer feedback should not only be used to build dashboards, although this is important. You should also <strong>process feedback individually<\/strong>, by implementing appropriate processes. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Triggering an alert to generate a customer service reminder when a customer expresses dissatisfaction.<\/li>\n<li>Inviting satisfied customers to join your refer-a-friend programme, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It is up to your company to determine which actions to trigger depending on the customer\u2019s answers. This makes customer feedback a direct business lever. It either enables you to avoid a loss in revenue (handling of dissatisfied customers), or to generate additional revenue (handling of satisfied customers).<\/p>\n<h3>Integrating customer feedback in your customer information system<\/h3>\n<p>A customer feedback solution should always be integrated to your company\u2019s <strong>software ecosystem<\/strong>. Particularly to your CRM, which still serves as a customer database for a lot of companies, but also to your customer service software, or analytics software (Google Analytics etc.). To make this integration as easy as possible and to enrich all your tools, MyFeelBack <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfeelback.com\/en\/integrations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has developed several connectors<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Sending a survey to a customer is a touchpoint in itself. This touchpoint should be part of your overall marketing plan. <strong>This is essential to coordinate your communication and manage the marketing pressure in a global way.<\/strong> The quality of your customer relationship is at stake.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a practical example. There are two ways to deploy a survey by email:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Via your customer knowledge solution, for example MyFeedBack<\/li>\n<li>Via your marketing solution, for example Adobe Campaign, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We recommend the second solution. Below is the process to follow:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create your survey using your customer knowledge solution.<\/li>\n<li>Add it to your campaign or email scenario in your marketing solution.<\/li>\n<li>Synchronise your answers with your customer knowledge solution. They are then valued, analysed and processed before being fed back into your company\u2019s different tools.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Implementing a customer feedback programme will enable your company to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand new customer expectations \u2013 buying intent, journeys, new habits, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Qualify incoming after-sales service requests \u2013 relieve pressure on customer services, direct requests, refer to help centre content.<\/li>\n<li>Monitor customer satisfaction with any measures you take \u2013 offer adapted services, rate the effectiveness of certain measures, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We hope this article has helped you understand the importance of the Voice of the Customer in this post-Covid transformation of the customer relationship, marketing strategies and customer experience.
