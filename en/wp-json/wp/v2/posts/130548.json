It was initially tested on a select number of accounts during May 2020 and was made available worldwide in November. This new Instagram tool allows <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hivency.com\/en\/platform\/smart-matching\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span>content creators<\/span><\/a> and brands to group posts relating to a <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">common theme<\/span>: recipes, favorite restaurants, DIY\u2019s, decoration, shopping etc. Its format is similar to a blog in the sense that it <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">alternates image and text<\/span> to present a cohesive narration to users and consumers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Guides is available in three formats:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Places: by choosing this format it\u2019s possible to <strong>share posts by location<\/strong>.

Consumers aren\u2019t interested in a \u201cproducts I agreed to talk about\u201d guide. It\u2019s important to <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">create guides through a narrative approach<\/span>, choosing a concrete topic, especially since we\u2019re dealing with a format very similar to the blog. This time of year brings ideal topics for guides where your product can be included: \u201cMy Christmas Wish List\u201d, \u201cChristmas presents ideas\u201d etc.<\/p>\n<h3>A step further with ambassadors<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you haven\u2019t done it yet, consider <strong>launching an ambassadors program<\/strong> to take your relationship with your favorite influencers one step further. Being a brand ambassador means that the influencer will take more <strong>genuinely and sincerely<\/strong> about your product. The influencer\u2019s relationship with your brand will be closer than with any other, and they could even <strong>create a dedicated guide<\/strong> to the posts done in collaboration with you.

At first, users didn\u2019t really get Instagram Stories, it took them a while to get used to IGTV, and even now there was a positive uproar over t<strong>he new layout and the additional Instagram Store<\/strong>. These reactions are due to the fact that a huge factor in the success of social media is <strong>its ability to form habits and routines<\/strong> in its users, that don\u2019t appreciate it when the comfortable environment they interact in is <strong>disrupted<\/strong>. This makes introducing new features and evolving an <strong>extremely delicate process<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Guides, however, is <strong>one of the few additions<\/strong> that hasn\u2019t been met negatively.
