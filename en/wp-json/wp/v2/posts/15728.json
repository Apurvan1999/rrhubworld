For many <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/retail\/\">retailers<\/a>, these two months can account for more revenue than all other major holidays combined. And 2015 is expected to be especially strong in the United States. <\/span><a style=\"line-height: 1.6;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/Article\/Happy-Holiday-Season-Expected-Retailers\/1012898\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eMarketer<\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"> forecasts that <strong>U.S. sales in the final two months of 2015 will increase 5.7% over last year<\/strong>, reaching $885.70 billion in 2015 for all retail purchases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Last year\u2019s holiday season customer service winners, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, were <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/customer-centric-lessons-amazon\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/how-customer-satisfaction-ranks-nordstrom-at-the-top\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nordstrom<\/a>, two brands with strong reputations for providing <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/build-relationship-of-trust\/\">exceptional customer service<\/a>. \u00a0Both brands benefit from a high degree of customer engagement and loyalty, and have groomed the American consumer to expect the highest standards of service, value, and transparency.<\/p>\n<p>In order to prepare for the holiday rush, retailers should follow Amazon\u2019s and Nordstrom\u2019s lead by <strong>providing a seamless customer experience that\u2019s fast, reliable, and customer-centric<\/strong>. By adjusting how they approach and target today\u2019s savvy consumer, retailers can leverage the holiday shopping season for boosting sales and improving <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/fashion-industry\/\">customer loyalty<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>\u00a0<\/h2>\n<h2>1. Personalize to build customer loyalty<\/h2>\n<p>Today\u2019s customers have come to expect personalized experiences, which companies like Amazon and Nordstrom recognize as key to engagement. A recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/products\/marketing-cloud\/customer-interaction\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MyBuys study<\/a> found that <strong>39% of customers are frustrated with retailers who don\u2019t provide a personalized experience<\/strong> which offers, for example, product recommendations in real time based on shopping and browser information. Likewise, 45% state that that they want retailers to take every channel (in-store, online, mobile, etc.) into account to provide the best possible experience.<\/p>\n<p>As customer expectations continue to rise, <strong>retailers must use data intelligently, providing individualized, non-intrusive, and relevant offers to increase customer satisfaction<\/strong>. Whether its greeting customers with special offers as they enter the store, sending personalized emails, or tailoring offers based on feedback surveys, personalization increases customer loyalty and engagement, making it a top priority. Of course, your customers know they aren\u2019t your only customers but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t want to feel like they are.<\/p>\n<h2>\u00a0<\/h2>\n<h2>2. Gather Feedback to build customer loyalty<\/h2>\n<p>One of Amazon\u2019s greatest strengths is that it encourages customers to freely review products and services, increasing transparency and value for customers. Best Buy, another leading U.S. retailer, has taken customer feedback a step further by rewarding customers for completing product reviews. It\u2019s a win-win for everyone. <strong>Customers are rewarded, and their feedback is shared internally before being passed on to venders to help make improvements where necessary<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Feedback is critical for developing a brand\u2019s products and services but keep in mind that customers are busy during the holidays. Respect your customers who may feel a bit reluctant to provide feedback at this time of year. To avoid frustration or fatigue, consider designing a quick feedback survey, one with a clear, focused goal. Know what your objectives are so as to <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/maximize-survey-response-rates-perfect-wording\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create the simplest and most efficient survey<\/a> possible. And consider adopting the Best Buy approach to rewarding customers for their time. \u2018Tis the season for giving, after all, so consider offering a coupon, discount, or low-cost gift to incentivize and thank survey-takers.<\/p>\n<h2>\u00a0<\/h2>\n<h2>3. Go Above and Beyond<\/h2>\n<p>From a financial standpoint, it\u2019s just good business sense to treat customers well, especially true during a time of year that can be stressful for shoppers. And while there may be no way to <strong>provide a 100% seamless customer experience during the holiday season, adopting a customer-first philosophy, and using a combination of the right tools and empowered frontline staff<\/strong>, is the best course of action. Empowered customer-facing employees will not only help put customers at ease during the busy holiday season but also produce positive word-of-mouth which can help a business\u2019s bottom line throughout the year.<\/p>\n<p>Nordstrom provides a perfect example of how to help customers overcome the stress of holiday shopping. After receiving special attention during a Christmas Eve rush, <a href=\"https:\/\/ctsmithiii.wordpress.com\/2012\/02\/03\/outstanding-customer-service-by-nordstrom\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one customer shared his experience online<\/a>, commending Nordstrom for its willingness to provide catered and friendly service even when things get rough. As the customer describes it, \u201c<em>It\u2019s Christmas Eve, the store is full of people, it\u2019s cold outside the parking lot is full\u2026and [the sales person] is asking if he can help take our bags to the car!<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While not exactly a dramatic story of superior customer service, it does provide a good example of how a company already known for it\u2019s high level of service remains consistent even when circumstances are less than ideal. And what better time of year to show customers how much they mean?<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-381919ff-e7c9-4fd1-aff8-9ed948a2e4e6\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-381919ff-e7c9-4fd1-aff8-9ed948a2e4e6\" id=\"hs-cta-381919ff-e7c9-4fd1-aff8-9ed948a2e4e6\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/20304540\/381919ff-e7c9-4fd1-aff8-9ed948a2e4e6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-381919ff-e7c9-4fd1-aff8-9ed948a2e4e6\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" height=\"340\" width=\"1700\" src=\"https:\/\/no-cache.hubspot.com\/cta\/default\/20304540\/381919ff-e7c9-4fd1-aff8-9ed948a2e4e6.png\" alt=\"2023-EN-SKP-FM-CTA-Discover our solution\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(20304540, '381919ff-e7c9-4fd1-aff8-9ed948a2e4e6', {\"useNewLoader\":\"true\",\"region\":\"na1\"}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The National Retail Federation (NRF) defines the holiday season as sales generated during the months of November and December.
