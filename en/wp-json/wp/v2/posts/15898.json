For many CRM options like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sagecrm.com\/en-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sage CRM<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/dynamics.microsoft.com\/en-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft Dynamics<\/a>, <strong>you can choose between a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.capterra.com\/top-3-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-installed-software-vs-saas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cloud version of the CRM or an on-premise version<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/crm-cloud-solution.png\" alt=\"CRM cloud version \" \/><\/p>\n<p>The cloud version offers most of the same services, with some limited customisation features. Unless you are a large enterprise with an entire communication system that you need to integrate into an on-premise CRM, going with the cloud option should work just fine for you and save you a lot of up front costs. Going with a cloud version also allows you mobile flexibility with your CRM, meaning your employees can sign on from anywhere: their mobile phone, their home computer, and of course, work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This can improve your team&#8217;s efficiency and make everything in your sales and marketing department run more smoothly.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>MyFeelBack is integrated with several CRM!

If the thought of filling in your entire CRM database overwhelms you, <strong>there are softwares like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfeelback.com\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MyFeelBack<\/a> that automatically sends out survey questions to customers to fill in the blanks in your CRM system.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This way filling in your customer data is automatised and you don&#8217;t have to spend your time sifting through customers to make sure that you have everyone&#8217;s birthday recorded correctly.<\/p>\n<p>Making sure that you have all of the data you need will make investing in your CRM worth it: <strong>if you&#8217;re not going to take the initiative to fill your CRM with the correct data, you might as well stick to using pen and paper.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>3 &#8211; Onboard effectively<\/h2>\n<p>Another key to effectively using your CRM is to <strong>onboard your employees correctly and effectively<\/strong>. A lot of times, a marketing department wastes money on their CRM because most of the employees never really learn to use it.<\/p>\n<p>Many CRMs <strong>offer onboarding programs to help companies<\/strong> get used to using the new system, and it&#8217;s really important to take full advantage of this. Sometimes it takes a couple of months to really get used to integrating the system into your company culture, but not doing so is a mistake that will cost you time and money later. If there is no onboarding option available for the CRM option you chose, it may be worth it to outsource a specialist for a few weeks to make sure your team learns the system.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 409px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/onboarding-plan-hubspot.jpg\" alt=\"onboarding plan of CRM hubspot\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Example of Onboarding Services by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/services\/onboarding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hubspot CRM<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>4 &#8211; Convert those leads<\/h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, you get a CRM to convert leads, and if this isn&#8217;t happening, then you are not getting a <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2017\/06\/you-can-make-your-sales-data-a-lot-better-with-a-little-discipline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">return on your investment<\/a> that will make investing in your CRM worth it. <strong>Make sure your sales and marketing team thoroughly understand how to use your CRM to push toward your all over goal, which should be converting more leads, keeping your current customers happy, and building customer loyalty. <\/strong>All of the data and analysing only means something if your customers and potential customers feel the difference.<\/p>\n<p>Getting a CRM system is a development that can transform your company.
