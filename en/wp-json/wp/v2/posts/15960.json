Take Kiehl\u2019s, for example. The brand has never advertised. Instead, the 165-year old purveyor of premium body-care products owes much of its global success to tailoring products and services to meet customers\u2019 needs. Word-of-mouth promotions, free in-store product consultations, and friendly, professional employees have enabled the brand, bought by L\u2019Oreal in 2000, to build its reputation as a <\/span><a style=\"line-height: 1.6;\" href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/crucial-steps-creating-customer-centric-business\/\">top customer-centric business<\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Founded as a pharmacy in New York\u2019s East Village in 1851, the brand has grown to over 250 stores worldwide, also selling products in luxury department stores and through its online shop. Walk into any Kiehl\u2019s shop and you will instantly feel relaxed by the minimal and well-organized space and helpful staff dressed in white lab coats. Kiehl\u2019s Customer Service Representatives (or \u201cKCRs\u201d as they are referred to within the company) are under no pressure to \u201cmake the sale\u201d. Instead, they are trained on how to educate customers about products, offering remedies for any skin type so that customers don\u2019t waste time or money.<\/p>\n<p>Cammie Cannelle, VP of Global Education and Customer Relations, describes <a href=\"http:\/\/keehuachee.blogspot.fr\/2013\/04\/kiehls-pioneered-todays-customer.html\">Kiehl\u2019s unique approach to customer service<\/a> this way: \u201c<em>When we are educating our KCRs, one of the first things we teach is the Kiehl\u2019s approach to service, for which our motto is \u2018We\u2019d rather make a friend than push a sale.\u2019 Our KCRs tell us that they love coming to work because, instead of selling, they get to be educators and problem solvers.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tailoring Customer Service<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In-store and online branding efforts are important to Kiehl\u2019s, providing the retailer with a clear point of differentiation and providing customers with a clear reason for shopping. But what really sets Kiehl\u2019s apart are <strong>the lengths to which it goes to understand individual customers, and how to best serve them<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Kiehl\u2019s links online and in-store databases to digital campaigns. <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/investing-crm-increase-small-businesses-loyalty\/\">CRM databases<\/a> are created from web signups, in-store profiles, and historical purchase behavior, and used in targeted email campaigns. Customers can be segmented down to exact items they have purchased, <strong>enabling Kiehl\u2019s to communicate specific messages to those customers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, visitors to the Kiehl\u2019s homepage are targeted with a promotional banner.\u00a0 Each customer\u2019s experience is shaped by his or her response to this banner. If a customer clicks on it, the offer remains persistent throughout the shopping experience. If the customer doesn\u2019t click on it, further banner offers appear until all banners have been exhausted. By <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/customer-segmentation-key-small-business-marketing\/\">segmenting customers into small groups<\/a> based on clicks and purchase behavior, Kiehl\u2019s empowers each customer with choices while also tracking a customer\u2019s journey throughout the entire shopping experience.\u00a0 Moreover, by gauging purchase history, Kiehl\u2019s can <strong>easily identify the impact each customer has on its revenue<\/strong> and, therefor, identify its most valuable customers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Connecting with Customers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Despite its lack of advertising, the brand has figured out an efficient way to communicate directly with its most valuable customers.\u00a0 Building strong engagement with customers is at the forefront of all Kiehl\u2019s sales and marketing initiatives.\u00a0 Here is a sampling of some of the ways they do it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In particular, Kiehl\u2019s has gone out of its way to focus on male shoppers, less experienced in buying and using grooming products. The company has designed an online magazine called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiehls.ca\/Welcome-to-The-Men%E2%80%99s-Wing\/kmw_article_39,default,pg.html\">The Men\u2019s Wing<\/a>, bringing Kiehl\u2019s products to life though informational videos.\u00a0 Customers can also submit personal questions that they may be too embarrassed to ask in person. Free shipping and free samples, as well as an automated auto-replenishing service, ensures that difficult-to-reach male customers remain engaged with the brand. And Kiehl\u2019s tailored approach to satisfying the needs of male customers has paid off handsomely, with the company enjoying a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.afr.com\/lifestyle\/fashion\/grooming\/the-secrets-inside-mens-vanity-cupboards-20150901-gjco63\">25% growth in male customers in 2014<\/a>. Currently, men make up <a href=\"http:\/\/www.afr.com\/lifestyle\/kiehls-cosmetics--history-in-a-bottle-20130912-jmep7\">1\/3 of the brand\u2019s global customers<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><em>SMS:<\/em> After a six months pilot period, the Kiehl\u2019s alerts campaign, designed to inform customers about products and services, generated noticeable sales. The company reported that <strong>73% of all customers signed up for the program with nearly 90% of those customers <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tatango.com\/blog\/sms-marketing-case-study-kiehls-experiences-73-redemption-rate\/\">making a purchase within the same six month period<\/a><\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0<em>Customer Feedback: <\/em>The company\u2019s website encourages customers to leave comments about product purchases, conveniently requesting those who do so to also submit information about gender, age, and length of Kiehl\u2019s consumption, all of which further enables the brand to specifically target unique segments.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Segmentation and lifecycle campaigns like these show that Kiehl\u2019s understands the importance of targeting individual customers. Clearly defining its customers enables the company to offer more relevant products and service, which help it to not only retain brand loyalists but also acquire new customers.<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--> <a href=\"http:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7-1.png\" alt=\"Download Ebook How Top Fortune 500 Companies Increased Their Performance Using Customer Feedback\" \/><\/a> <\/span> <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n\n        hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7', {});\n    \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span> <!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Any company that clearly understands its customers\u2019 needs \u2013 and methodically focuses on how to meet those needs \u2013 clearly differentiates itself from the competition.
