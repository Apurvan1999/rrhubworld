The objective? To facilitate the <strong>conversion<\/strong> of subscribers or users of the app into customers!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How does it work?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Users can<strong> fill in a form <\/strong>when they are interested in a product. It shows their <strong>sincere interest <\/strong>in the brand as well as its offer and allows the company to continue to send them, for example, relevant information by email.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2023\/06\/FR_2_process__1_.webp\" alt=\"TikTok GIF Generation Leads tool \" width=\"509\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 509px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">GIF credits : <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktokforbusinesseurope.com\/news\/tiktok-introduces-lead-generation-to-help-drive-customer-acquisition\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>This new TikTok lead generation tool also allows creating personalized <strong>messages for several customer segments.<\/strong> These leads can be <strong>downloaded<\/strong> manually or <strong>integrated into the company&#8217;s CRM automatically.<\/strong> For companies on the platform, these forms are essential, as they help to communicate with their prospects respectfully.<\/p>\n<p>By filling in the form, users are notified that TikTok is providing their information to advertisers: in this way, <strong>everything is done with the knowledge and permission of the potential customers.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>How can brands fully benefit?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>With this lead generation tool already tested in Spain by the brand Nina Ricci, TikTok <strong>is facilitating the conversion of the network audience<\/strong> into consumers for the advertising brands. To take advantage of this, a smart strategy is to launch <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hivency.com\/en\/your-needs\/launch-influencer-campaigns\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>influencer campaigns<\/span><\/strong><\/a> on the network.<\/p>\n<p>Many brands are still reluctant to join TikTok, and yet <strong>the network has proven its power of prescription among consumers<\/strong>. In addition to regularly releasing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/business\/fr\/blog\/introducing-business-creative-hub-content-inspiration-at-your-fingertips\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>new features<\/span><\/strong><\/a><strong>,<\/strong> TikTok has already shown that by collaborating with the influencers of the social network, brands will be able to attract their attention, capture their interest and then <strong>use the lead generation tool of TikTok to turn them into consumers.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Influencer campaigns generate much more trust among consumers than traditional advertising campaigns. <\/strong>It happens because consumers choose to follow content creators who share their values, experiences and interests. When these creators share a product they love, consumers are more inclined to<strong> trust their opinions <\/strong>for these reasons.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The case of Nina Ricci<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In Spain,<strong> luxury perfume brand Nina Ricci <\/strong>created an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktokforbusinesseurope.com\/fr\/inspiration\/nina-ricci\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>unboxing campaign<\/span><\/strong><\/a> for their latest fragrance with an influencer to test this new feature. In the video, a Call To Action was included that allowed users to fill in the form proposed by TikTok and in this way get a sample of the perfume. During the first 24 hours of the TikTok campaign, the brand noticed an<strong> impressive conversion rate of 41.85%<\/strong>, and a cost per lead <strong>85% lower <\/strong>than campaigns conducted out of the network.
