From smaller, independent brands to large corporations, everyone is getting in on the action and it\u2019s not slowing down anytime soon. This new form of marketing has been used across many industries\u2013 from entertainment to shopping and dining\u2013and is projected to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/digital\/giordano-contestabile-activate-by-bloglovin-guest-post-influencer-marketing-in-2018\/\">hit $10 billion in 2020.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>But don\u2019t take our word for it. Successful influencer campaigns have been picked up by leading brands such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/pauljankowski\/2019\/06\/28\/5-examples-of-heartland-brands-using-influencer-marketing\/#495b76fc5aa8\">Nissan, Naked Juice, and even Buffalo Wild Wings. <\/a>\u00a0Influencer marketing has shown to be a good tool for companies to increase sales, web traffic and overall brand awareness.<\/p>\n<p>But what makes it so effective? Using individuals as a way to promote a product isn\u2019t new &#8212; we\u2019ve seen it with celebrities like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.qsrmagazine.com\/marketing-promotions\/shaqs-papa-john-s-campaign-finally-arrives\">Shaquille O&#8217;Neal<\/a> endorsing products and brands making characters for their brands like, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90254247\/10-years-of-flo-the-story-behind-progressives-accidental-ad-icon\">Flo from Progressive<\/a>. In this day and age, it\u2019s the individual creators with their unique digital platforms and social media accounts that are creating a new form of digital advocacy for brands.<\/p>\n<p>If your brand is entering the sphere of digital marketing, it should be looking to influencer marketing. Here are the ways that influencer marketing can be an effective tool for your brand or company.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Creates Better Brand Awareness<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When a brand utilizes influencer marketing, they\u2019re putting in place individual ambassadors and advocates for their product or message. It\u2019s like having your own personal cheerleader for your brand. Digital creators have been on the rise for a while now with some creators reaching up to millions of followers on Instagram alone. In addition, each creator usually has their own type of content that can fall into a specific category, including beauty, fashion, parenting, cooking, technology, and other niche categories.<\/p>\n<p>Having influencers promote your product gives your brand authenticity and credibility. Instead of having a random talking head tell potential consumers why a product is great, you can have a real person show how your product is something they can use in their everyday life or for a specific purpose.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Generates Content for your Brand<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The word \u201caesthetic\u201d is much more than a fluff word, it\u2019s a description that you want to have when someone describes your brand\u2019s social media presence. Your brand\u2019s social media image is a part of your brand identity nowadays. Content generation is something that a company needs to accumulate for their respective pages in order to establish a clear and consistent brand.<\/p>\n<p>What makes influencer marketing good for your social media feed is that influencers are creating content for you and spreading visual marketing through their individual blogs and pages. By creating a meaningful and authentic partnership with an influencer, you in turn are creating more opportunities for growth in creative and effective content through the influencer\u2019s individual page.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Opportunity to Increase Sales<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Social media marketing is best used when it can send your customer base to another external source, such as sending them to buy a product or service, engage with your campaign or product, or even sign up for a newsletter. Influencer marketing is a tool that can be used to increase these numbers.<\/p>\n<p>Along with brand visibility and an abundance of content, influencer marketing can directly lead to higher sales for your specific product or general ecommerce site. Data collected in 2016 showed that<span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/internet\/2016\/12\/19\/online-shopping-and-e-commerce\/\"> eight in ten<\/a><\/span> Americans now shop online and that 55% of consumers make shopping choices based on what they discover through social media.<\/p>\n<p>The more influencers you have advocating for your brand, the better. And because it\u2019s through an authentic medium, customers will connect to the influencer, thus connecting to your product better. Influencer advocacy and engagement sends more traffic to your preferred platforms\u2013via a \u201clink in the bio\u201d or direct swipe-up link via Instagram Stories\u2013 sending traffic from influencers\u2019 pages straight to your website or online store.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Provides Both Quality and Quantity Customer Growth<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At the end of the day, people want to trust their brand, so they enjoy being sold products from other individuals they relate to. In turn, your brand needs customers that are loyal to your brand and are trusting of your products. When growing a consumer base for your brand, quality is as important as quantity, and influencer marketing gives you both.<\/p>\n<p>An authentic brand brought through an influencer helps bring in more committed and engaged customers because they are pulled towards the brand through their pull towards the influencer. Through influencer marketing, brands and companies are creating more loyal, excited and engaged customers.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Request a Demo<\/h2>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/go.octoly.com\/l\/172312\/2020-02-14\/449x6c\" width=\"100%\" height=\"750\" type=\"text\/html\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" style=\"border: 0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>Related Articles<\/h2>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Influencer marketing has reached brands from every corner of the internet.
