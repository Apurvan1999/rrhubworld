Collecting customer data is a source of endless opportunities for companies that care about their customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>It is an important step before analysing and processing data and, most importantly, using it. It will enable you to anticipate your customers\u2019 needs, address their problems and increase satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p>On average, companies that implement a customer knowledge strategy improve their satisfaction rates by 30 to 50%.<\/p>\n<p>To collect data, you need a method, and creating a smart survey is a proven way to get to know your customers better.<\/p>\n<p>Read on to find out how to carry out effective data collection.<\/p>\n<h2>Which Customer Data Should you Collect and Why?<\/h2>\n<p>You should view customer data as a tool, not an endpoint. If you collect information without a goal in mind, you may find yourself overwhelmed.<\/p>\n<p>The first step for effective collection is therefore to define your marketing and business objectives.<\/p>\n<p>This will enable you to identify which data you need and how to use it.<\/p>\n<h3>Some Examples of Customer Data Collection Goals:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Improving customer loyalty<\/li>\n<li>Improving your customer service<\/li>\n<li>Measuring the success of a recently launched product or service<\/li>\n<li>Increasing your sales on different channels, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Data Collection Goals Answer the Following Questions:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What<\/strong>: which performance indicators do you want to see? (conversion rate, NPS, repurchase rate, etc.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>When<\/strong>: which points of contact will you question your customers on? (when leaving your website, on the product pages, etc.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Who<\/strong>: which data do you need? (web page URL, customer ID, specific shop, etc.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>How<\/strong>: what tools do you need to put in place to collect this data? (post-purchase survey, exit pop-up, post-contact survey, etc.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 302px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/data-collection-answer-questions.jpg\" alt=\"Data collection questions\"><\/p>\n<p>You then need to determine which data is the most important for your business.<\/p>\n<p>All information does not hold the same value. But the more you know about your customers, the better you can serve them.<\/p>\n<p>Different types of data you can collect:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contact details: <\/strong>first name, last name, address, telephone number and email address, so that you can easily communicate with your customers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Business-specific information:<\/strong> each company has specific needs in terms of customer data. For example, a shop specialising in shoe sales should know their customers\u2019 shoe size and favourite brand.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Customer history data:<\/strong> this determines your customers\u2019 experience with your company. For example, what they don\u2019t like, any problems you\u2019ve resolved for them in the past, etc. But also, your customers\u2019 history with your competitors, such as why they decided to switch.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Personalisation data:<\/strong> birthday, number of people in the household, favourite sports team, etc. Knowing your customers well will help you improve your customer experience in the long-run.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How to Become an Expert in Customer Data Collection<\/h2>\n<p>Now you know the basic data to collect and what your goals are, here are five tips on how to get the most out of these customer insight surveys.<\/p>\n<h3>1&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;Determine When to Survey your Customers on the Customer Journey<\/h3>\n<p>Start by recreating <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/customer-journey-mapping\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the customer journey<\/a>, from beginning to end. Review the information you need to provide your customers with effective services.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 491px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-journey-image.jpg\" alt=\"customer journey\"><\/p>\n<p>This process is a great opportunity to bring your team together and talk about any obstacles they may have come across as a result of a lack of customer information. Their feedback is priceless and will make it a lot easier to decide which type of data to collect.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have a complete list of data to collect, ask yourself this question for each one: when is the best time to ask my customer for this information? This will help you determine the groups of data to collect at each customer stage.<\/p>\n<p>You should not try to collect everything at once. Customers can easily feel harassed. You need information, but you shouldn\u2019t apply too much marketing pressure. Favour quality over quantity.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure that your survey only asks for data that is really useful. You\u2019ll get other opportunities later to enrich this information.<\/p>\n<h3>2&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;Facilitate data collection<\/h3>\n<p>Collecting customer data is easy, whether in a fun or more formal manner.<\/p>\n<p>Identify simple points of contact that make sense, to collect data without being intrusive. For example, the creation of a customer account, signing up to a newsletter or taking part in a competition. If you\u2019re an online retailer, plan actions that are triggered automatically, such as a pop-up for new visitors, so as to better understand their expectations with regards to a particular product.<\/p>\n<p>Train your teams to implement your plan. If you are collecting data in store, remember to provide your employees with tablets rather than paper (additional manpower, risk of input errors when digitalising data, etc.).<\/p>\n<h3>3&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;Make your Surveys Enjoyable or Light-Hearted to Collect Maximum Data<\/h3>\n<p>Your surveys don\u2019t have to be cold, soulless forms. Add a bit of life and personality!<\/p>\n<p>The context matters of course, and it\u2019s easier to make a fun survey if you work for a toy shop than if you sell funeral services.<\/p>\n<p>But whatever your industry, there is always a way to add a more human touch to your surveys.<\/p>\n<p>For example, at MyFeelBack, you can add pictures to your answer choice, to make your surveys lively and fun.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 468px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/images-choice-surveys.jpg\" alt=\"Images choice survey\"><\/p>\n<p>To make your surveys less intrusive, you can collect customer data by asking indirect questions. This will enable you to collect missing information, as well as easily identify your personas.<\/p>\n<p>In the above example, you can easily determine the respondent\u2019s familial status. The question asks respondents what their home means to them. A person living alone is unlikely to click: \u201cA safe haven for your whole family\u201d. Instead, they might select the first answer: &#8220;Your first, you\u2019re still looking for inspiration\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>By asking this question indirectly, you\u2019ll gather important information about your customer and easily feed your contact database.<\/p>\n<h3>4&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;Tell the Customer why you Need Data<\/h3>\n<p>One way to ensure that customers don\u2019t see your survey as a chore is to simply explain why you need the information.<\/p>\n<p>Reassure your customers.<\/p>\n<p>With MyFeelBack\u2019s surveys, you can easily explain why you are collecting data with the \u201cfurther information\u201d item.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 622px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-survey-data-collection.jpg\" alt=\"Customer data collection survey\"><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget that to be GDPR compliant, you must be transparent about your use of customer data.<\/p>\n<p>Add a few comments to your survey and, above all, ensure that when sending or triggering a survey, you clearly explain how the customer\u2019s data will be used, to make their experience beneficial.<\/p>\n<h3>5&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;Use Data to Enchant your Customers<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you have the information, use it to better sell your products and services, but also to surprise and delight your customers.<\/p>\n<p>Customer enchantment doesn\u2019t have to be complicated or expensive. Just a little extra something that makes the customer remember you.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sending a card when their favourite football team wins the league.<\/li>\n<li>Sending a personalised email with a special offer for their birthday.<\/li>\n<li>A little gift or discount when they place a big order.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At the end of the day, a well-built survey, aimed at collecting information, is an excellent way to get to know your customers. The above tips and guidelines are a great starting point!<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-f872a7d4-15de-4afd-a4ce-28e373eec588\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-f872a7d4-15de-4afd-a4ce-28e373eec588\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-f872a7d4-15de-4afd-a4ce-28e373eec588\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/f872a7d4-15de-4afd-a4ce-28e373eec588\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-f872a7d4-15de-4afd-a4ce-28e373eec588\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/f872a7d4-15de-4afd-a4ce-28e373eec588.png\" alt=\"Download 15 questions\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'f872a7d4-15de-4afd-a4ce-28e373eec588', {\"region\":\"na1\"}); \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s no secret.
