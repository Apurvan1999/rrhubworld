It is more difficult to analyse the results of an open-ended question because of its qualitative nature. Yet, <strong>asking open-ended questions<\/strong> can prove to be <strong>very useful for getting to know your customers better<\/strong>. So, why and how should this type of questions be used?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\">What purpose do open-ended questions serve in a customer survey?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1 &#8211; Open-ended questions are less biased<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Open-ended questions allow to collect <strong>qualitative answers<\/strong> from customers that are, for the most part, <strong>full of information<\/strong>. By asking this type of question, you are giving your customers the opportunity to answer whatever they like, <strong>without limiting <\/strong>or <strong>influencing<\/strong> them with predefined answers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your customers can answer freely. It is not always possible to answer a closed-ended question; sometimes <strong>none of the available choices reflect<\/strong> your viewpoint. People don\u2019t always fit in the boxes!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/limits-closed-ended-questions.jpeg\" alt=\"limits-closed-ended-questions\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, don\u2019t be surprised: most of your customers will only spend a few seconds on an open-ended question. This will actually make it easier to interpret their comments though, so it is not a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of customer knowledge, open-ended questions present another advantage. The answers to closed-ended questions are ones chosen by you. <strong>But have you thought of everything?<\/strong> You risk finding what you are looking for, but not <strong>what your customers actually think<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking open-ended questions is <strong>a way of opening up to new ideas<\/strong>, to unanticipated answers. These questions are often very instructive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2 &#8211; Open-ended questions are ideal for understanding perceptions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A near-spontaneous answer is particularly useful when evaluating and measuring <strong>brand or product awareness<\/strong>, and more broadly, <strong>how they are perceived by customers<\/strong>. Take the following example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/example-open-ended-question.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/example-open-ended-question.jpg\" alt=\"example-open-ended-question\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3- Improved interactions via surveys<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Open-ended questions make customers feel valued. By asking an open-ended question, you are <strong>giving a voice to the respondent<\/strong>, thus letting them know that their personal opinion is important and that their answers will not simply be fed into automatically generated statistics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/open-ended-question-voice-customer.jpg\" alt=\"open-ended-question-voice-customer\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An open-ended question also allows <strong>to break the monotony<\/strong> of a series of these questions. An open-ended question arouses the respondent\u2019s interest, surprises them and dispels their automatic reflexes. In other words, an open-ended question helps <strong>make your<\/strong> <strong>customer survey more dynamic<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, there are numerous and undeniable advantages to using open-ended questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">What difficulties can arise with these questions?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So why, in spite of everything, are open-ended questions often missing from customer surveys, or do they represent such a small minority? A number of disadvantages can be identified <strong>if the processing method for these questions has not been sufficiently anticipated<\/strong>. Let\u2019s take a closer look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, it is <strong>difficult to use answers to these questions in statistics<\/strong>. The answers, qualitative by very definition, do not lend themselves easily to a quantitative analysis. Yet, it can never be said enough &#8211; <strong>the analysis of customer survey results<\/strong> is a critical step.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t use <strong>verbatim ana<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>lysis software<\/strong>, you will have to read all the answers manually, and try to <strong>sort them by category<\/strong>, for statistical purposes. Which, in all honesty, is particularly time consuming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the processing of open-ended question answers is not the only drawback:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Answers collected from open-ended questions are <strong>not always very interesting<\/strong> or useable. Take great care when formulating your questions to avoid leading respondents off-topic.<\/li><li>Most respondents will simple skip open-ended questions. <strong>The response rate<\/strong> for open-ended questions is always far inferior to closed-ended questions. Make sure that <strong>your deployment is sufficiently widespread<\/strong>, in order to achieve strong sampling.<\/li><li>Some respondents are not used to expressing themselves in writing, and their answers are <strong>not always very clear<\/strong>, readable or easy to understand. <strong>Adding an example to the question<\/strong> can help guide respondents without influencing them.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/open-ended-question-adding-examples.jpg\" alt=\"open-ended-question-adding-examples\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\">How to use this kind of questions in surveys?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to be aware of the positive and negative aspects of open-ended questions, in order to successfully incorporate them into your customer surveys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open-ended questions allow to find out things you would never have known by only asking closed-ended questions. It is therefore recommended, when necessary, to use open-ended questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use open-ended questions when they bring added value<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t overdo this sort of questions<\/strong>. Analysing open-ended question answers is difficult, and time-consuming if you don&#8217;thave any tool. We strongly recommend against designing a survey with an equal number of open-ended and closed-ended questions. If you are using text analysis software, we recommend adding <strong>an open-ended question every 3 questions<\/strong>. If you plan on analysing the answers yourself, only include one open-ended question for every 5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is sometimes possible to acquire sufficiently qualified answers via closed-ended questions. There is no need to ask an open-ended question <strong>if you can<\/strong> <strong>use a closed-ended one<\/strong> instead. Ask yourself if an open-ended question will add any real value compared to a \u201cclosed\u201d answer. Think about it from a <strong>customer knowledge perspective<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/bad-uses-open-ended-question.jpg\" alt=\"bad-uses-open-ended-question\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/substitutes-open-ended-question.jpg\" alt=\"substitutes-open-ended-question\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For smart surveys, open-ended questions can <strong>only be deployed under certain conditions<\/strong>. If, in the case of an NPS question, the assigned score is low, an open-ended question will help you understand the reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Encourage your respondents to provide concise answers to your open-ended questions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t hesitate to <strong>ask your respondents for short answers<\/strong>. You could specify the number of answers for example: \u201cName 5 smartphone brands\u201d. Or add an adverbial phrase in the question, such as: \u201cin a few words\u201d, \u201cin one sentence\u201d, etc. Short answers are quicker to analyse. They are also often<strong> clearer<\/strong>, because they are more direct. Below is an example that perfectly illustrates these last two points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>To find out more, discover <\/strong><strong>our <a href=\"\/en\/blog\/ultimate-guide-creating-customer-survey\">Ultimate guide to creating a customer survey<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use verbatims analysis tools<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been mentioned previously in the article. Software of this kind allows to <strong>detect the terms most frequently mentioned by respondents<\/strong>, or to identify the negative or positive polarities in the verbatim responses. This allows you to gain a deeper understanding of answers to open-ended questions and to save a lot of time that would otherwise be spent on analysis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"650\" height=\"160\" class=\"alignnone\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 160px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/open-ended-question-answer-analysis.jpg\" alt=\"question-answer-analysis\"><br><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Example of polarity analysis of verbatim with <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Skeepers<\/a><\/em><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skeepers CX<\/strong> offers a <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/verbatim-analysis-transform-customer-comments-kpis\/\">verbatim analysis<\/a> module on our Enterprise Feedback Management platform.
