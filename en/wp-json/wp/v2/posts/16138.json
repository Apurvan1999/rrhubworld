The meeting of its subsidiaries highlighted the need to be able to reconcile, analyze and exploit a large volume of data, with a view to automating marketing actions previously prepared and launched manually.<\/p>\n<p>It is in this context that Advalo was chosen in 2015, to meet the need for a technical but above all intelligent automation tool, which will be able to segment ever more data, identify the potential of each client or prospect, and push the right messages, at the right times to increase lead rate and their transformation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Use Case<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The majority of the actions implemented by BodemerAuto have focused on relaunching prospects following the completion of a lead.<\/p>\n<p>Today, if \u2153 of the leads received by the group come from its own website, the remaining \u2154 are sent from other external sites such as specialized advertising sites like Le Bon Coin or manufacturers&#8217; sites, such as Renault.<\/p>\n<p>When a prospect expresses a lead by filling out, for example, a contact form, they are immediately integrated into a personalized marketing action reminder system intended to confirm and accompany their project until the final purchase made within the BodemerAuto dealership ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>Several campaigns are then implemented sequentially over time and on different points of contact (email, call, SMS &#8230;).<\/p>\n<p>When the prospect responds positively to one of these requests, it generates a second lead and is directly contacted by the dealerships teams.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">The results<\/span>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The BodemerAuto prospect follow-up campaigns generated a re-engagement rate on the second lead by + 4.40%.<\/p>\n<p>By comparing the results of the individuals targeted by the campaigns with those relating to the non-targeted individuals, we observe that <strong>327 additional individuals confirmed their first lead by carrying out a second following the recovery campaign.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Unsolicited individuals show a re-engagement rate of + 2.54%, a variation of more than 74% between prospects integrated into the recovery system and those with whom no specific action has been taken.<\/p>\n<p>The different campaigns implemented via the Advalo platform therefore directly amplify the volume of new leads after the creation of the first lead.<\/p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>Discover the use case in infographic&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><\/h1>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/infographie_cas_bodemer-06.png\" alt=\"infographie_cas_bodemer-06\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">___________________<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em>\u00ab Advalo has shown us the power and credibility of its algorithms and models, whether it is to precisely and cleanly segment the database according to customer or customer prospect behavior or for the subsequent implementation of relevant campaigns . \u00bb<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Also find <a href=\"\/en\/advalo-viewed-by-antoine-bourdy-marketing-manager-at-bodemerauto-automotive-dealership\" rel=\" noopener\">here<\/a> the interview with <strong>Antoine Bourdy<\/strong>, Marketing Manager at BodemerAuto, and our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.advalo.com\/en\/individualized-marketing-platform-automotive-industry\" rel=\" noopener\">auto page<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>About BodemerAuto<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2012, BodemerAuto is the trademark of the Bodemer group, a family business created in 1926.
