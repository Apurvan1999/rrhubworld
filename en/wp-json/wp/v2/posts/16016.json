But investing in the right tools is equally important.<\/p>\n<p>In the last ten years, social media and mobile have forever changed how customers shop and interact with brands. The combination of these elements has pushed transparency and responsiveness to the forefront of business success. Consumers have, essentially, forced businesses to adopt a new customer service model, one in which <strong>businesses are always connected, listening, and responding to customer feedback<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Discover <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/top-brands-collect-customer-feedback\/\">How 10 Top Brands Collect Customer Feedback (And Are Awesome At It)<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 308px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/social-chanels-connected.jpg\" alt=\"social channels connected for customer experience\"><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not all businesses are prepared to meet the challenge. While most companies offered multiple channels through which to serve customers, <strong>the majority lacked the ability to track the history of a customer\u2019s experience across multiple channels<\/strong>. This means that a customer who attempts to obtain service online but switches to phone must start from scratch in addressing a given service concern. Businesses sould make a greater effort to ensure that the channels offered are seamless and based on customer preferences rather than internal motivations.<\/p>\n<h2>Five Ways to Create Seamless and Efficient Support<\/h2>\n<p>Customer satisfaction is attainable as long as a business stays on top of the tools available to achieve it. And, fortunately, there are <strong>a variety of tools available to help customers and increase satisfaction<\/strong>. Here are five suggestions:<\/p>\n<h3>Add automated surveys<\/h3>\n<p>Implementing non-obtrusive surveys and encouraging customers to complete them honestly and fully, remains one of the most effective ways to gather customer feedback. Surveys can be issued at point of purchase, in a post-sale email, or in a post issue-resolving conversation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Discover our <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/ultimate-guide-creating-customer-survey\/\">Ultimate Guide To Creating A Customer Survey (With Questions!)<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 594px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-relationship-crisis-nps.jpg\" alt=\"customer surveys email example\"><\/p>\n<h3>Embrace social media<\/h3>\n<p>There is no question that social media has changed how customers interact with brands, leaving up-to-the-minute reviews, complaints, and critiques of products and services. And since research shows that churn rate can <strong>increase by 15%<\/strong> when companies are perceived as non-responsive on social media channels, social media must be made a customer satisfaction priority.<\/p>\n<h3>Enable fluid channel switching<\/h3>\n<p>While embracing social media is crucial, just as important is how well a business integrates the various channels. This has become a clear customer priority with 43% of participants in a recent survey stating that they expect customer service channels \u2013 web, email, voice calls \u2013 to be integrated with social media channels.<\/p>\n<h3>Introduce self-service support<\/h3>\n<p>Help customers get answers and resolve problems in the least amount of time. 40% of customers in a global survey of 3,000 said they prefer self-service to humans for customer support; <strong>70% expect a company to provide a self-service portal<\/strong>. Of course, this doesn\u2019t eliminate the need for customer service staff, but it does suggest that customers desire both choice and efficiency.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 488px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/self-service-portal-myfeelback.jpg\" alt=\"Self service portal of myfeelback\"><\/p>\n<h3>Engage proactively<\/h3>\n<p>Simply waiting around for customers to call or email won\u2019t work in today\u2019s customer centric environment. To be truly <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/crucial-steps-creating-customer-centric-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customer centric<\/a> \u2013 and establish a clear point of distinction \u2013 today\u2019s businesses must be able to identify and reach out to customers who experience trouble long before they contact a company.<\/p>\n<p>Adopting real-time, easy-to-use feedback tools enables a company to be more proactive and either anticipate or immediately respond to a customer\u2019s needs. By no means an exhaustive list of the tools available to help service customers, these five suggestions provide a good place to start. Leveraging the right tools to provide better customer support will help any business stay on top of its performance, making it easier to meet \u2013 and exceed \u2013 customer expectations.<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-19ce45fb-90af-42b3-a84b-d2824acacbbb\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-19ce45fb-90af-42b3-a84b-d2824acacbbb\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-19ce45fb-90af-42b3-a84b-d2824acacbbb\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/19ce45fb-90af-42b3-a84b-d2824acacbbb\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-19ce45fb-90af-42b3-a84b-d2824acacbbb\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/19ce45fb-90af-42b3-a84b-d2824acacbbb.png\" alt=\"download our  Template of  Customer Knowledge  Action plan\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n hbspt.cta.load(744484, '19ce45fb-90af-42b3-a84b-d2824acacbbb', {}); \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the new world of ecommerce, social media, apps, and call centers, customer satisfaction is as important as ever.
