Reassess your goals<\/h2>\n<p>Goals are <strong>great motivators<\/strong>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbescoachescouncil\/2017\/10\/05\/are-your-goals-really-worth-achieving-how-even-smart-goals-can-go-astray\/?sh=66b999a8483c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unless your goals are bad<\/a>. But what\u2019s a <strong>bad goal?<\/strong> It\u2019s anything that is unrealistic, unattainable, vague, or out of one&#8217;s control.<\/p>\n<p>Bad goals can also be goals that are too easy. If your team doesn&#8217;t feel challenged, or like they are given any control, they will <strong>find intellectual stimulation elsewhere<\/strong> (such as wasting company time on Facebook or playing minecraft).<\/p>\n<p>If your team is going through a bad situation, it&#8217;s time to reassess your goals. Bear in mind that even if you think your goals are realistic, <strong>your team might not agree with you<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>You can for instance, <strong>schedule a meeting<\/strong> and ask your team whether or not the goals you&#8217;re setting are inspiring or discouraging them.<strong> Listen to their input and adjust accordingly<\/strong>, as making sure they feel heard and understood is also very important to take into account.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Survey your customers<\/h2>\n<p>One of the <strong>most frustrating<\/strong> things that can happen to a marketer is putting your heart and soul into a marketing campaign and then <strong>NOT seeing the results you expected<\/strong>. Mostly, this happens because you are <strong>incorrectly targeting<\/strong> your product or service.<\/p>\n<p>If your marketing team is <strong>failing<\/strong> to create successful campaigns, it&#8217;s time to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/tips-effective-customer-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">send out a survey\u00a0to your customers<\/a>. <strong>This will help your team<\/strong> better understand who they are creating these campaigns for.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 730px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG-newlanticcity-survey.png\" alt=\"customer knowlage survey\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n<p><strong>Tip<\/strong>: Allow your team to create the questions they would ask themselves. This will allow them to think about any<strong> missing pieces of information<\/strong> they wish they had about the customers they are trying to reach through marketing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Discover <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/cmo-should-know-customers\/\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">5 Things every CMO Should Know About Their Customers<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It has some good recommendations for survey questions that get great results.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Incorporate learning into your day<\/h2>\n<p>Feeling overwhelmed? Feeling burned out? or simply frustrated? Your department may be <strong>suffering from a lack of learning<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Incorporating team learning into your daily routine is a great way to <strong>keep your company up to date<\/strong> on the newest marketing technologies, and in the world of fast evolving digital media, this is an absolute necessity<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-align: center;\">Learning also naturally <\/span><strong style=\"text-align: center;\">boosts your spirit<\/strong><span style=\"text-align: center;\">, expands your mind, and helps you think outside the box. If you&#8217;re in the marketing industry and not actively interested in <\/span><strong style=\"text-align: center;\">learning new things<\/strong><span style=\"text-align: center;\">, find a new job!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Measure things!<\/h2>\n<p>One of the greatest ways to <strong>feel empowered at work<\/strong> is to quantify your success in a way you can measure.<\/p>\n<p>Get your marketing team set up with <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/sales\/sales-metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some KPI&#8217;s<\/a> that you can continually track, to <strong>record your progress over time<\/strong>. It will keep your team united over tangible goals, allow individuals to track their progress in tangible ways, and add a level of organization and efficiency to your campaigns that will help you better determine when things are going right, and when they are going wrong<\/p>\n<p>Make sure to <strong>match your KPI&#8217;s<\/strong> to your existing goals.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 307px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/team-spirit-after-crisis-kpis.jpg\" alt=\"objectives vs kpi\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n<h2>5. Don&#8217;t panic<\/h2>\n<p>Last but not least, as a leader, it&#8217;s your job to <strong>maintain your cool attitude<\/strong> and try not to panic. Marketing difficulties can lead to a lot of negative feedback from upper management because any mistake you make is often visible and public.<\/p>\n<p>However, remember that no marketing team gets it right everytime, and whatever negative thing that occurred can actually <strong>help your team grow and get better<\/strong> if you make the best of using what you learned in the right way.<\/p>\n<p>Put on a brave face, show up, and show your team that you&#8217;ve got this. Even if you don&#8217;t feel in control at first, <strong>fake it until you make it<\/strong> and you will soon see that things aren&#8217;t as bad as you feared.<\/p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t win everytime, and marketing departments naturally go through ups and downs as they try new things. But using these tips can help you to <strong>get everyone feeling and thinking their best<\/strong> so that your next effort is a guaranteed success!<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-7b84010b-8ac9-4c08-a18a-6e4c710c1fd9\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-7b84010b-8ac9-4c08-a18a-6e4c710c1fd9\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-7b84010b-8ac9-4c08-a18a-6e4c710c1fd9\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/7b84010b-8ac9-4c08-a18a-6e4c710c1fd9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-7b84010b-8ac9-4c08-a18a-6e4c710c1fd9\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/7b84010b-8ac9-4c08-a18a-6e4c710c1fd9.png\" alt=\"Download your memo\" \/><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n hbspt.cta.load(744484, '7b84010b-8ac9-4c08-a18a-6e4c710c1fd9', {\"useNewLoader\":\"true\",\"region\":\"na1\"}); \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Marketing has to deal with many issues&#8230; You can\u00a0strategize, create, and design until you&#8217;re blue in the face but until your marketing campaign is out there for the public to consume, you&#8217;ll never really know whether it will succeed or fail.
