There\u2019s no doubt that this technology will make a big comeback over the next few months.<\/p>\n<p>QR codes can be used in many ways.<\/p>\n<p>Did you know that you can use QR codes to deploy your customer satisfaction surveys? This article explores why and how you should measure your customer satisfaction using QR codes.<\/p>\n<h2>QR Codes are Making a Comeback<\/h2>\n<p>QR codes never really took off with European consumers. They\u2019re rarely used, but things are changing with the health crisis\u2026 QR codes are back! Entrance to a number of public venues (restaurants, cinemas, gyms, etc.) will probably soon be conditioned by mobile apps based on these two-dimensional barcodes.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, more and more digital players are launching or updating this technology. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalinformationworld.com\/2021\/02\/google-chrome-has-gained-ability-to.html\">Google has recently added a QR code generator to its Google Chrome browser.<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 460px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Google-qr-code-share.jpg\" alt=\"QR code google\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Use cases for this technology will increase over the coming months. Including measuring and improving customer satisfaction.<\/p>\n<h2>QR Codes can be Used to Measure Customer Satisfaction<\/h2>\n<h3>Measuring Customer Satisfaction is a Must<\/h3>\n<p>Measuring customer satisfaction has become essential in order to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show your customers that you\u2019re interested in them, in how they feel, their experience, their relationship with your brand, and that your company listens to customer expectations. Measuring customer satisfaction is a way of enriching your customer relationship.<\/li>\n<li>Identify irritants on your customer journey and detect areas for improvement to your services, products and customer experience. As we often say, you need to measure customer satisfaction before you can improve it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>To go further, discover our\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/ultimate-guide-creating-customer-survey\/\">Ultimate Guide To Creating A Customer Survey (With Questions!)<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Deploying Satisfaction Surveys with QR Codes is Easy<\/h3>\n<p>You can use lots of different channels and medias to collect customer feedback. With a solution like MyFeelBack, you can deploy customer satisfaction surveys by email, on your website (in the form of a pop-up, button or chat), on social media, by SMS, by phone\u2026 and with QR codes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 454px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/qrceodes-myfeelback-deployment.jpeg\" alt=\"QR Codes surveys deployment \" \/><\/p>\n<p>We offer an easy-to-use QR code generator that enables you to create customised codes linking to your survey pages. You can add your logo at the centre of the code or change the QR code colours to match your brand\u2019s visual identity.<\/p>\n<h3>QR Codes, a Bridge Between the Physical and Digital World<\/h3>\n<p>QR codes bridge the gap between the digital and the physical, between online and offline. In many ways, they represent what is known as &#8220;phygital\u201d, the fusion of the physical and digital. They are placed on a physical media and link to a digital web page.<\/p>\n<p>QR codes allow you to measure your customer experience in-store instantly. They can also be used to measure customer satisfaction following the delivery of a package or after a physical event. QR codes can be used in lots of different way and are, by definition, multi-media. You can print them on posters, flyers, brochures, invoices, websites, etc.<\/p>\n<h3>The Benefits of QR Codes for Customer Feedback Collection<\/h3>\n<p>QR codes allow to collect customer feedback and instantly measure customer satisfaction, as closely as possible to the customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>The second benefit of QR codes is that they allow to collect feedback without the respondent\u2019s contact details. This channel is useful when a company wants to collect feedback from consumers who are not identified as customers.<\/p>\n<p>QR codes are also easy to use. In a world where mobile phones play an ever-increasing role, the QR code is a valuable tool that fits nicely<strong> into the customer journey.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>2 Tips for your QR Code Surveys<\/h2>\n<p>Are you thinking of deploying customer satisfaction surveys using a QR code?<\/p>\n<p>If so, we recommend:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using <strong>short surveys<\/strong>. This rule applies to all instant surveys. We recommend limiting the size of instant surveys to 5 or 6 questions at the most. This will increase engagement as well as your response rate. This is especially true of QR surveys which, by definition, are completed on a smartphone.<\/li>\n<li>Avoiding <strong>open questions<\/strong>, for the same reasons as above. It is more difficult to type on a smartphone than on a computer. Generally speaking, mobile phone surveys should be easy to fill in, and made up of closed questions and simple answer choices (boxes to tick, emojis, scales, etc.).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 512px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/question-satisfaction-quality-price-1.jpg\" alt=\"Questions following QR code smartphone \" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Measure Satisfaction at all Stages of the Customer Journey<\/h2>\n<p>Finally, we\u2019d like to share a few more general tips with you about how to structure your customer satisfaction measuring system. What are the key steps?<\/p>\n<p>The first is to identify the main stages and contact points on your customer journey, those known as the \u201cmoments of truth\u201d in your customer experience. For example, in e-commerce, the key stages include product search, purchase, delivery, customer relations (after-sales service\u2026) and loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend measuring customer satisfaction at these key stages as they impact the customer experience the most.<\/p>\n<p>The second step is to identify the &#8220;items&#8221; to measure at each stage.<\/p>\n<p>For example, for the &#8220;Delivery\u201d stage this could include delivery times, method of delivery or package collection, state of the package, the product, etc.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 200px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/buyerjourney-1.jpg\" alt=\"Buyer journey\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once these items have been identified, you can build your surveys. This is the third step: creating campaigns (one-off surveys) or scenarios (surveys triggered after a customer event).<\/p>\n<p>There are several sub-steps when building surveys:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Phrasing the questions and answers.<\/li>\n<li>Choosing the deployment channel.<\/li>\n<li>Defining your target, i.e., the customer you want to send the survey to.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The format of your survey depends on the channel you choose. For a survey deployed in the form of a QR code, it\u2019s best to keep it short and only use closed questions.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The use of QR codes is set to increase over the coming months. Now, more than ever, the time has come to use them and include them in your voice of the customer strategy.
