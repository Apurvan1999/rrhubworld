In this post we will discuss four reasons why social media is a must-have tool for any CRM Manager.<\/p>\n<h2>#1 It allows for real time communication and access<\/h2>\n<p>In today\u2019s instant world, customers have begun to expect to be able <strong>to constantly connect with their favorite brands<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>While many companies fill this need by providing 24 hour a day, 7 day a week customer service, another (cheaper) way to be constantly available for your customers is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/how-to-handle-customer-complaints-via-social-media\/\">through social media<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Many companies have social media accounts, specifically Twitter and to a lesser extent Facebook, that are available <strong>to respond to complaints, praise, and questions from customers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>It is common nowadays for customers to \u201ctag\u201d companies in order to alert them of a concern.<\/p>\n<p>Companies can respond back using social media and address customer questions quickly, efficiently, and at all times of the day.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 450px !important;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG-1-Twitter.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\">Upwork<\/a> is an example of a company who does a great job of <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/UpworkHelp\">using Twitter to respond to customer concerns <\/a>and keep them updated about any technical issues.<\/p>\n<p>Above, you can see screenshots of an Upwork user having their questions responded to by Upwork\u2019s \u201chelp\u201d account regarding a technical issue.<\/p>\n<p>Below are examples of Upwork\u2019s technical issues updates that they often provide on their \u201chelp\u201d\u00a0 Twitter account.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 450px !important;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG-2-Upwork.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/overview\">Facebook is another way customers can get in touch with their favorite brands<\/a>, and <strong>being a responsive company definitely pays off.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Facebook even goes so far as to note on your Facebook page how quickly you typically respond to messages, making <strong>it add to your feeling of legitimacy as a company if you respond quickly<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 350px !important;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG-3-Facebook.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>#2 It shows you who your customers are<\/h2>\n<p>Another great thing about social media is that it gives <strong>a very comprehensive and complete view of a customer<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>When you view your customers accounts on social media you are able to see <strong>what kind of person they are not just as consumer but as a dynamic, emotional, motivated person<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>What language do your customers use to communicate? What are their family lives like? What do they do for a living? What other brands do they like?<\/p>\n<p>All of these are essential questions you must know in order to be a successful CRM manager, and they are all questions <strong>that can be answered with social media<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>#3 It\u2019s a great place for customer reviews<\/h2>\n<p>If you establish a strong social media presence, you can take <strong>advantage of customer review options that are available on Facebook<\/strong>, and less official versions available on Twitter and Instagram.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>When you create a Facebook page for your company, customers can actually go to your page and <strong>provide a review for your business along with feedback<\/strong>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Having this quick and easy review system is a way to gain<strong> good word-of-mouth promotion for your brand<\/strong> because you have real customers providing their good reviews for other visitors to see publicly.<\/p>\n<p>If you have any doubt if reviews are good for your business, consider this: According to a 2012 Local Consumer Review Survey, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/learn\/local-consumer-review-survey\/\">74% of consumers say that positive reviews make them trust a local business more<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, but <a href=\"http:\/\/simplymeasured.com\/blog\/influencer-marketing\/#sm.000014jjk7fwj4d98td8uzznmuz4k\">74% of consumers rely on social media to inform their purchasing decisions.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>#4 It helps you find free marketing opportunities<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most useful parts of using social media as a CRM manager is that it <strong>allows you to spot the people who go out of their way to comment about, review, or follow your company<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>When there are customers who make an effort to tag your company in one of their posts or write a really awesome review about one of your products, it is important to take note of these people and <strong>cultivate a relationship with them, because they are potential brand ambassadors<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Brand ambassadors can be one of your marketing departments greatest assets, not just because they provide essentially free advertising, but also because consumers are <a href=\"http:\/\/simplymeasured.com\/blog\/influencer-marketing\/#sm.000014jjk7fwj4d98td8uzznmuz4k\">so much more likely to trust peer recommendations and reviews than paid advertisements.<\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Having brand ambassadors speak about your brand on social media is a great way <strong>to build trust with your base and a legitimate brand<\/strong>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>However, in order to have this happen, you first need to find these brand ambassadors, and being aware of mentions and tags on social media is a great way to start this process (another great way to find brand ambassadors is through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfeelback.com\/en\/features\">NPS surveys<\/a>, which we discuss in <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/net-promoter-scores-good-bad-ugly\/\">another post.<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>No matter what image you want to set forth as a CRM manager, being on social media is absolutely essential. If you work to build an active, responsive, fun presence on social media, you will undoubtedly find important connections and opportunities.<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-fe084c73-3009-4584-9202-61f865b104c7\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-fe084c73-3009-4584-9202-61f865b104c7\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-fe084c73-3009-4584-9202-61f865b104c7\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"http:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/fe084c73-3009-4584-9202-61f865b104c7\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-fe084c73-3009-4584-9202-61f865b104c7\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/fe084c73-3009-4584-9202-61f865b104c7-1.png\" alt=\"download the customer satisfaction ebook\" \/><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'fe084c73-3009-4584-9202-61f865b104c7', {}); \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a CRM Manager, it is your job to protect your company\u2019s relationship with its customers.
