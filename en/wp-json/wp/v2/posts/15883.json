Despite the fact that this is a relatively well accepted fact in the marketing world, it seems like many companies are still behind when it comes to utilizing the latest customer knowledge technologies and tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">One of these tools that, well relatively common, isn&#8217;t being used as often as it should be is <strong><em>buyer personas<\/em><\/strong>. Buyer personas are detailed, specific fake profiles of target customers. They are used to give marketers a very <strong>specific idea of exactly who they are speaking to when they create a piece of content.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">When created and used correctly, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ajagrawal\/2016\/08\/02\/how-to-create-a-successful-b2b-marketing-strategy\/?sh=6b2f447a3e82\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buyer personas are central to a comprehensive marketing plan<\/a> and extremely useful marketing tools to insure that you are consistently targeting your correct audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">And yet, buyer personas are often overlooked or not taken seriously enough by marketers who assume that they already know who they are writing to, or who don&#8217;t bother considering their audience when they write at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">This is a grave error as content is written without a distinct buyer persona in mind often lacks clarity, focus, relevancy, and proper verbiage. This blog post lays out 5 huge benefits of personas that everyone can take advantage of if they take the time to create detailed personas for their company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/use-buyer-persona-marketing.jpg\" alt=\"Buyer Personas profile\" class=\"wp-image-18828\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\">1 \u2014 They help you humanize your audience<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Whenever you have marketing plan that failed, you can almost always trace part of the problem back to a misunderstanding of who your customer is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">This misunderstanding can come from a lack of data, but it can also come from a failure to humanize your audience. This is precisely what buyer personas are for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">When you create buyer personas, something shifts in the psychology of your marketing. Suddenly, you aren&#8217;t just marketing to a bunch of blank faces. You are marketing specifically to Jamie, or Mark, or Anna, and <strong>you have a clear image of who this person is<\/strong>. It doesn&#8217;t matter that it&#8217;s not a real person, because you know that this data is built on the information of your real customers. Being able to look at this persona as a person with specific attributes and feelings makes writing to them that much easier and <strong>will absolutely help you to write in a more efficient, effective way.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/blog-buyer-persona-marketing.jpg\" alt=\"Different personas\" class=\"wp-image-18829\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-buyer-persona-push-you-to-ask-the-right-questions\">2 \u2014 Buyer persona push you to ask the right questions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great thing about buyer personas is that <strong>they get your company thinking about the customer in the right way<\/strong>. In order to make a successful buyer persona, you need to ask your current and potential customers <strong>the right questions to get a feel for who they are<\/strong>. These questions are things like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>How old are you?<\/em><\/li><li><em>What is your job title?<\/em><\/li><li><em>Who do you report to at work?<\/em><\/li><li><em>What is your greatest challenge in the workplace?<\/em><\/li><li><em>What helps you get your job done right?<\/em><\/li><li><em>What resources are you lacking? <\/em><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/use-buyer-persona.jpg\" alt=\"Survey chat\" class=\"wp-image-18827\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">These questions help you create a buyer persona that is accurate and comprehensive, but they also help you to build up your company&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/3-tips-to-convince-your-customers-to-share-personal-information\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">customer knowledge<\/a> database, which is something you should be doing anyway. In other words, making buyer personas is a great first step to becoming a more customer knowledge minded company in general. These are the questions all marketing departments should be asking their customers, buyer persona or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\">3 \u2014 They get everyone on the same page<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Another benefit to buyer personas is that they are <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/ways-to-use-buyer-personas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">usually able to be used by everyone in the marketing department<\/a>, sometimes even the entire company. Getting your team centered around two or three static buyer personas is a <strong>great way to unify your marketing message and get everyone on the same page<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">As a marketing department, you want to be sure that every step of your strategy is aligned. The content writers on your team are <strong>targeting the same specific niche as your graphic designers and your sales team<\/strong>. Buyer personas simplify this and get results in a really easy and effective way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/blog-use-buyer-persona.jpg\" alt=\"Call To Action\" class=\"wp-image-18830\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\">4 \u2014 Buyer persona keep you focused in your writing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">If one major benefit of buyer personas is humanizing your audience, the other is definitely <a href=\"https:\/\/www.geckoboard.com\/blog\/buyer-personas\/#.WZQoIXcjHX8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keeping you focused<\/a> while you brainstorm and write. It is so easy to get carried away when you are coming up with content ideas day after day. Having a specific buyer persona that you are always targeting to will be a little check point in your head that <strong>helps you filter ideas<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Is this an article that Bruno would want to read? Will this statistic interest Bruno? Am I telling Bruno something he already knows?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">All of these questions are things <strong>you can ask yourself when you have a well detailed buyer persona next to you that you can reference<\/strong>, and it will save you a lot of time and editing later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap5\">5 \u2014 Buyer persona lead you to real potential clients<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">The last benefit of buyer personas that we will discuss here is that <strong>they open the conversation to help you find real leads<\/strong>.
