They offer an <strong>innovative way to deploy customer surveys<\/strong>. The surveys are conducted in the form of a conversation, that look like this:<\/p>\n<p>More and more e-commerce players have added chatbots to their websites. But MyFeelBack\u2019s <strong>ChatSurvey is the first conversational assistant that focuses on customer knowledge and feedback<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>ChatSurveys enable you to ask your customers questions during a conversation. This offers your customers a more engaging experience because it is smoother, more natural and personalised.<\/p>\n<p>So, how can you turn your survey into a ChatSurvey? This article will answer this question and provide some advice about how to create surveys that are adapted to this new deployment mode.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 717px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/talky-en.gif\" alt=\"Chat survey example\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>ChatSurveys, or the art of conversation<\/h2>\n<p>When building a ChatSurvey, keep in mind that you are trying to simulate a conversation. <strong>You should not ask your question or questions directly, but instead imitate certain characteristics of human conversations.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Begin by greeting the respondent and introducing yourself. For example: \u201c<em>Hello, my name is Thierry and I would like to ask you a few questions about your experience buying from [Name of your company]<\/em>\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>You can also add a personalised field {Nom} after \u201c<em>Hello<\/em>\u201d to include the respondent\u2019s first name. MyFeelBack offers this option. This form of introduction is more or less the same as the one in a traditional survey.<\/p>\n<p>You can then add transitions between your questions. For example, you could begin with, \u201c<em>Thank you for your answer<\/em>\u201d, before asking the next question. Another example: if a customer answers a satisfaction question with a rating of 4\/10, you could write something like: \u201c<em>I\u2019m sorry to hear that you were not fully satisfied with our services.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/chatsurvey-customer-study.jpg\" alt=\"Chat surveys\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ideally, ChatSurveys should feel as much like a natural conversation as possible and not just a series of questions, like in a traditional survey.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You should try to simulate a question and keep this objective in mind when creating your ChatSurvey (or when turning a classic survey into a ChatSurvey).<\/p>\n<p>For your information, MyFeelBack provides you with support and more than 20 standard questions to help you create your conversational surveys.<\/p>\n<h2>How many questions should you include in a ChatSurvey?<\/h2>\n<p>There is no ideal number of questions in a survey. It depends on your survey, its relevance and smoothness, your survey\u2019s target audience, your ability to analyse and exploit the answers, the relationship you have with your respondents, etc.<\/p>\n<p>With ChatSurveys, you can create smoother, more engaging and enjoyable surveys for your respondents.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 538px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/chatsurvey-customer-satisfaction.jpg\" alt=\"Chatsurvey customer experience\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Asking too many questions defeats the primary benefit of ChatSurveys &#8211; a smooth experience.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that ChatSurveys are most often triggered during the buying journey. Asking too many questions could lead the customer to end their journey.<\/p>\n<p>It is also rare to ask 10 questions in a row during a real-life conversation. Asking too many questions could make the conversation feel unnatural.<\/p>\n<p>For all these reasons, <strong>we therefore recommend limiting your questions to those that are the most important for your strategy<\/strong>. You will obtain more relevant customer answers and a better conversion rate, without compromising the customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>In order to adapt to the very specific format of ChatSurveys, you need to take a new approach to survey design. This will enable you to fully benefit from this innovative survey deployment mode and enter the era of relationship marketing.<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-88a9bdd4-b144-498c-8289-4a126c75abd7\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-88a9bdd4-b144-498c-8289-4a126c75abd7\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-88a9bdd4-b144-498c-8289-4a126c75abd7\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/88a9bdd4-b144-498c-8289-4a126c75abd7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-88a9bdd4-b144-498c-8289-4a126c75abd7\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/88a9bdd4-b144-498c-8289-4a126c75abd7.png\" alt=\"book your demo\" \/><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n hbspt.cta.load(744484, '88a9bdd4-b144-498c-8289-4a126c75abd7', {}); \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ChatSurveys are a MyFeelBack innovation.
