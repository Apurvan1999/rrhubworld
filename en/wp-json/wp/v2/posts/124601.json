In February 2021, Eva NYC re-launched their haircare portfolio in 100% recyclable aluminum. All of the products are certified cruelty-free, vegan, non-GMO, and free from harsh chemicals like parabens, sulfates, and phthalates. <\/p>\n<h3>Challenge<\/h3>\n<p>Eva NYC has worked with Octoly for the last two years to support their awareness objectives, utilizing the platform for several campaigns. \u201cPrior to working with Octoly, our process was mostly manual and relatively time-consuming,\u201d says Ashley Evans, Director of Digital Marketing at Eva NYC. \u201cFrom influencer vetting and identification of talent who made the most sense for the brand, to shipping and tracking the success of our organized gifting efforts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Eva NYC looked to Octoly\u2019s platform as a way to make their influencer gifting process more seamless and communicate new messages through influencers and UGC more effectively. This has included the relaunch of the haircare products in recyclable aluminum packaging. They also wanted to seed products for authentic eCommerce text reviews in tandem with new product launches. <\/p>\n<h3>The Solution<\/h3>\n<p>Ashley says that working with Octoly for organized influencer gifting has not only streamlined the process but also allowed them to have a community-based approach with all influencers. \u201cOctoly has become a funnel for new influencers and content creators that Eva NYC otherwise may not have connected with,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can build long-lasting relationships with nano and micro-content creators, giving them the opportunity to sample and experience the brand, prior to inviting them to be a part of greater influencer initiatives, in either a gifting or paid capacity.\u201d Ashley also credits Octoly with better allowing the brand to easily target specific audiences, such as Gen X or millennials. <\/p>\n<h3>Results<\/h3>\n<p>The content created using Octoly\u2019s influencers not only communicated new launches and messages in a clear way to targeted audiences, but has also been high-quality enough to be repurposed into shoppable galleries across Eva-NYC.com, alongside social channels. Creating a more interactive way to shop, Octolys content made up 30% of UGC for the new packaging launch (which reached over 350,000 users during the campaign period). Eva NYC\u2019s sales have increased over 100% since last year.<\/p>\n<p>Working with Octoly\u2019s broader consumer community for eCommerce text reviews, Eva NYC has also been able to generate reviews for new product launches with a 95% recommendation rate. \u201cBeing able to sample our new products and generate reviews at launch time is great to give consumers a sense of which new products will be best for them and their hair goals,\u201d says Ashley Evans, Director of Digital Marketing at Eva NYC.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The results in 1 year<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Influencer\u00a0 Posts<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>750<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">REACH<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">12M<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Interactions<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">796K<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">ENGAGEMENT<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">4.30%<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOctoly is a phenomenal platform partner for driving brand awareness through organized gifting, specifically to nano and micro-influencers.
