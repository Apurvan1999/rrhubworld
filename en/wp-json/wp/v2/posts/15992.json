The company\u2019s success is due, in large part, to its uncompromising customer-centric mission, making the process of buying and selling a home easier and more transparent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Redfin agents are paid a salary and receive benefits, with customer satisfaction ratings<\/strong> \u2014 not transactions \u2014 determining each agent\u2019s bonuses. Using a combination of service and technology, the company is able to promote the most relevant listings to buyers, get them into properties faster, and help them save time and money.<\/p>\n<p>Customer care drives every aspect of Redfin. Here\u2019s how.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tHiring the right people<\/h2>\n<p>According to Chief Executive Officer Glenn Kelman, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/08\/25\/business\/be-yourself-redfins-glenn-kelman-says-even-if-youre-a-little-goofy.html?_r=0\">the company is very selective when it comes to hiring agents and tech developers<\/a>. New hires must understand and help contribute to Redfin\u2019s mission to fundamentally change the way people buy and sell homes.<\/p>\n<p>Redfin strives to encourage innovation, believing that risk taking leads to innovation. \u201c<em>The only bad idea is the one left unsaid, so let the ideas flow freely. We\u2019re all ears,<\/em>\u201d the company\u2019s website states in its recruitment pages. Redfin is constantly looking people with the skill and drive to <strong>help make the real-estate processes faster, friendlier, and more efficient for customers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tMaintaining customer centric values<\/h2>\n<p>Integral to Redfin\u2019s success are its values, which are broken down into five categories:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\t\t<em>Fire:<\/em> Being mission-driven, acting like an owner, and finishing the job.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<em>Wow<\/em>: Delighting customers.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<em>Rally:<\/em> Being inspirational, curious, fearless and resourceful.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<em>Genuine:<\/em> Being caring, humble, and balanced.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<em>Honorable<\/em>: Doing the right thing, putting customers first, being truthful regardless of consequences, and treating others with respect.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As its values demonstrate, <strong>Redfin sees itself as a customer advocate whose success is wholly determined by customer satisfaction<\/strong>. Kelman has said that he is not familiar with any other real estate broker <em>\u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.inman.com\/2014\/11\/15\/redfin-has-risen-still-an-industry-disrupter\/\">that has so much money riding on whether the client is happy<\/a>.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>\n\tGathering client feedback<\/h2>\n<p>Each month, Redfin sends a feedback survey to its customer.&nbsp; Regardless of the results, positive or negative, <strong>the survey feedback is published quarterly as part of the company\u2019s ongoing commitment to maintaining transparency<\/strong>. All reviews for each Redfin agent are published on their online profiles <a href=\"https:\/\/www.redfin.com\/real-estate-agents\">so customers can see for themselves how agents have performed<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of earning commission proportional to the sale price, agents earn a commission based on customer satisfaction. Therefore, Redfin agents are inherently motivated to work on behalf of the customer&#8217;s best interest, instead of their own, delivering a superior value proposition to the customer.<\/p>\n<p>Customers understand from the start that Redfin agents are not going to inflate the price as high as possible in order to earn a higher commission. There is no need to do so since agents are paid entirely based on customer satisfaction ratings. This customer-first business model likely explains why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.redfin.com\/about\/press\/releases\/c-sat-2\">97% of customers say they would recommend Redfin agents<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tDisrupting the Market<\/h2>\n<p>Home buying and selling can be a stressful experience, so Redfin\u2019s commitment to providing a successful, customer-friendly experience is a huge bonus.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And soliciting customer feedback is an important part of providing this experience<\/strong>.&nbsp; According to a Redfin survey of nearly 1,000 recent homebuyers and sellers, most consumers thought that agent responsiveness was the most important aspect of the home buying and selling process. Consumers want to know that their agent will be responsive and work on their behalf. Because customer feedback about each agent is clearly displayed on Redfin\u2019s website, buyers and sellers can rest assured that they are, in fact, working with the best agent.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/wa-redfin-idUSnBw165459a+100+BSW20150916\">According to Panle Jia Barwick<\/a>, associate economics professor at Cornell University, by collecting and sharing \u201c<em>more information about agents\u2019 track records, companies like Redfin are making\u2026real estate more efficient<\/em>,\u201d saving consumers time and money.<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\" id=\"hs-cta-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\"><!--[if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--> <a href=\"http:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Download Ebook How Top Fortune 500 Companies Increased Their Performance Using Customer Feedback\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7-1.png\" style=\"border-width:0px;\"><\/a> <\/span> <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n\n        hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7', {});\n    \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span> <!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Redfin, the Seattle-based real estate brokerage company, combines customer feedback, technology, and second-to-none customer service to deliver a better real estate experience.
