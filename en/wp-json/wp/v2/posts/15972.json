By filler content, we mean <strong>hastily written<\/strong>, non-researched blog posts and information graphics that are artificially pumped up with SEO keywords in an attempt to get clicks.<\/p>\n<p>Writing filler content like this is <strong>a waste of everyone&#8217;s time, both yours and your readers<\/strong>. Not only is <a href=\"https:\/\/searchenginewatch.com\/sew\/how-to\/2390744\/are-keywords-relevant-to-seo-in-2015\">Google catching on to artificial keyword density in garbage articles<\/a>, but your readers will catch on too; and they won&#8217;t appreciate having their time wasted by being sent to an unreliable site, and this will affect <strong>your customer experience.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Instead of spending time pumping out high quantities of filler content, spend your time writing <strong>half as many quality pieces of content and then share them via social media and email <\/strong>twice as often as you would with garbage articles. You&#8217;ll save everyone a lot of time and headache, and you&#8217;ll get meaningful and repetitive traffic to your site.<\/p>\n<h2>#2 Live tweeting- use automation!<\/h2>\n<p>Social media is great for instant updates, but it can also be very time consuming to log on to Twitter and Facebook 5 or 6 times a day in order to post.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why live posting should only be reserved for <strong>things that need to be talked about in the moment<\/strong> &#8211; such as breaking news or live tweeting from events.<\/p>\n<p>For your daily social media posts, rely on <strong>automated posts instead to save you time<\/strong>. Tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/\">Hubspot<\/a> (we\u2019re using it) and even free softwares like <a href=\"https:\/\/hootsuite.com\/\">Hootsuite<\/a> allow you <strong>to schedule social media posts in advance so that you can get all of your social media posting out of the way on Monday morning<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 359px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Capture-HubSpot-MFB-1.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>#3 Blind marketing<\/h2>\n<p><strong>One of the most important habits to ban from your marketing routine? Marketing without knowing your audience<\/strong>. So many marketing campaigns are created based on an unresearched and unfounded idea of what the company <em>thinks <\/em>their audience wants and needs.<\/p>\n<p>Your customer base and online audience are often far from <strong>what you believe them to be<\/strong>. This is why you need <strong>to conduct <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfeelback.com\/en\/features\">targeted research<\/a><\/strong> in order to get a <strong>realistic idea of who your customers are and who you should be marketing to.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Smart surveys, interviews, and competitive audits are all great ways to do this<\/strong>, but make sure to reassess your customer base every quarter as it is likely to grow and change.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><a href=\"http:\/\/get.myfeelback.com\/lp-ebook-customer-satisfaction-learn-from-customers-en\"><strong>Click here to discover why learning from your customer is essential and how to ask the right questions!<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 322px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Capture-Aloha-Airlines-1.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>#4 Gathering too much data<\/h2>\n<p>Learning about your customers <strong>is excellent and necessary as a marketer<\/strong>. However, many marketing teams often fall into the trap of collecting a ton of data, and then not properly analyzing it.<\/p>\n<p>With data collection, the same rule applies as with content creation: <strong>Less is often more, and always go for quality over quantity<\/strong>. For any data collecting initiative, <strong>choose 3-4 metrics that you hope to measure<\/strong>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2013\/03\/know-the-difference-between-yo\">make sure they are the right ones<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It will allow you to really dive and make sense of what you find out.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>#5 Rewarding customer acquisition over customer retention<\/h2>\n<p>It is very common in marketing to focus on winning new customers. In reality, at least half of your efforts should be spent <strong>on keeping your current customers happy<\/strong>&#8211; and that means <strong>increased customer satisfaction and maximizing the customer experience<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The key to a successful marketing campaign is being able <strong>to invite new people<\/strong> in while you also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.candybar.co\/blog\/loyalty-rewards-programs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reward those who have been around<\/a>. That&#8217;s why creating <strong>a company culture is so important<\/strong>; it makes your current customers feel like <strong>they are &#8220;in&#8221;<\/strong> on your culture, and makes new customers curious about what you have to offer.<\/p>\n<p>It can be tempting to focus on campaigns that will attract new blood; but in order to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kissmetrics.com\/improve-churn-rate\/\">keep your ROI high and reduce churn<\/a>, <strong>you need to make sure your current customers are happy and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/31852\/A-Marketer-s-Guide-to-Accumulating-Awesome-Online-Reviews.aspx\">speaking highly of you.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 399px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Capture-Testi-Blog-MFB.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Are these habits something you and your colleagues are guilty of?
