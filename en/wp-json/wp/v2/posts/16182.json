Stop putting means before strategy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong> Objectives, Strategy &amp; Means<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To succeed in digital marketing, one has to make the distinction between means, strategy, and<br>objective. Objectives are what we want to achieve, for example, Lead acquisition, Lead quality,<br>and customer loyalty. To reach these goals, different routes may be taken. The routes are the<br>different possible strategies. In digital marketing, we can combine inbound and outbound<br>marketing strategies. And finally, there are means. In the context of inbound marketing, the<br>means are for example content, social networks, scoring, and marketing automation. These are<br>the elements that laid end to end feed into strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take that to another situation: Tennis: If the objective is to win the next match. We could adopt<br>a new offense and defense strategy. When playing the attacker, means are service and<br>knocking the ball over the net in midair and by hand. For defense, it will be endurance and the<br>game at the end of the court.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarily, when a tennis man trains to knock the ball over the net because they have chosen an<br>offense strategy, a marketer is going to work on their blog articles because they have chosen an<br>inbound marketing strategy. It is therefore absurd to speak about blogging strategy, because<br>blogging is just a means, among others, at the service of the chosen strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to stop focusing on means<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u201cproblem\u201d in digital marketing is the profusion of means made available to marketers. There<br>are so many possibilities that it is difficult to make a choice. We are tempted to test all of them.<br>Being enticed to take on everything, eventually leads to being out of breath and wanting to stop<br>in our tracks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The obsession with growth hacking entices marketers to immediately seek the winning move.<br>And lots of strategies require regularity in order to be performant. For example, when embarking<br>on creating new content, one often needs 6 to 9 months to see tangible results. To avoid<br>burning out, one must move away from this build-up of means and take control. Stop focusing<br>on means and relearn how to unwind and find new objectives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\"><strong>2) Set the wheels in motion to get the virtuous circle into first gear<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not because of the wide range of possibilities at our disposition is hefty that we have to use<br>it all. Dispersion is counter-productive. In order to set the wheels in motion, one has to choose a<br>strategy and go for it. For example, if we make the choice of using a content strategy, we are<br>not going to start immediately writing a bunch of articles. Further upstream, in order to correctly<br>create a virtuous circle, we should rely on personas and keyword analysis. Afterward, start by<br>creating 2 or 3 articles per month and implement the promotion on social networks, email, as<br>well as bloggers and influencers in order to obtain backlinks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If these first steps are done well, the virtuous cycle will snap into place. Once correctly amplified,<br>the content will gradually generate traffic. On that basis, the contact list will grow. The site will<br>gain in notoriety and authority. Therefore SEO traffic and incoming links improve and positioning<br>of keywords becomes more fluid.. and so forth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same comprehensive way, we can put a virtuous circle into place with a publicity strategy<br>and PR, events strategy \/ sponsoring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\"><strong>3) The key to success: start on a solid foundation<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For Rand Fishkin, Moz founder, each strategy has its merits and own mechanism. Is it not the<br>strategy which is chosen that will result in a virtuous circle. It is primarily the act of basing<br>strategy on a solid foundation. Influencers insist on the importance of self-managing their<br>website and contacts. In order to be performant, one needs to have control over their content<br>and audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we choose to focus on content marketing, the fundamental requirements for being the most<br>efficient are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>optimized technical site (CMS, responsive, duration of page charge, efficient CTA and landing pages)<\/li><li>optimized site in terms of content (keyword choice, optimization, SEO &#8230;)<\/li><li>perfect knowledge of targeted clients(personas, pain points, challenges)<\/li><li>editorial strategy( what to talk about, to who, when, how, where)<\/li><li>visit tracking tool, nurturing campaign put into place, scoring and lead detection)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Without these elements, we cannot save ourselves from a hack.<br>The notion of a virtuous cycle, don&#8217;t exclude the notion of a hack. But growth hacking does not<br>substitute for strategy. It can be useful to clear an obstacle that appears in the virtuous circle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But without a solid foundation, it is impossible to succeed in digital marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All strategies reclaim consistency and time. Find a good starting point, and as you go along,<br>testing, and experimenting, results will be achieved, efficiency will be gained and ROI will be<br>improved. This is how, by advancing step by step, that a positive spiral is created.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrarily to what growth hacking can make one believe, one does not succeed in digital<br>marketing by with a one shot. To put all the chances on your side, it is better to put a virtuous<br>cycle into place, by constructing a solid foundation, and by adopting good practices that will<br>endure longterm. Wager on work and regularity than on flagrancy. Save our growth hacks for<br>when you need to get over points of contention that are blocking the advancement of funnel marketing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The number of techniques to master, ready to use tools, and data to be treated continue to discourage novice marketers.
