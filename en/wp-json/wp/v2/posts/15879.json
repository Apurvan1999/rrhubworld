These technologies are all about the CX world, and if you want to create a <strong>killer CX strategy<\/strong> that keeps you <strong>ahead of the competition, <\/strong>then you should be trying to find a way to <strong>incorporate them<\/strong> one way or another.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Discover the <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/7-customer-experience-conferences-attend\/\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">7 Customer Experience Conferences You Need to Attend in 2018<\/span><\/a><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>1- Highly Targeted Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Ads are so <strong>targeted<\/strong> these days, that people actually believe that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/technology\/2017\/10\/30\/facebook-listening-conspiracy-theory-refuses-die\/\">Facebook is listening<\/a> to their conversations, they think they&#8217;ll be talking about cat food with their family for instance and that at the next opening of their newsfeed: BAM! they get hit with cat food <strong>advertisements<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Not matter how <strong>conspiracy like<\/strong> it may or not seem, there\u2019s no doubt that one of the biggest ways that customer experience is being <strong>influenced by technology<\/strong>, is with the growing ability for companies to <strong>target customers<\/strong> with highly personalized <strong>marketing content.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><strong><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG-targetted-ads-scaled-1.jpg\" alt=\"targeted ads\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Customers are getting used to having ads be <strong>personalized<\/strong> to their needs and desires, <strong>they expect it<\/strong>, so this changes the customer experience in a few important ways.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; It improves the customer experience, by &#8220;<strong>wasting&#8221; less<\/strong> of a potential customer&#8217;s time with irrelevant ads.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; It raises the bar for what your customers expect to be exposed to, and customers who are proper targets for your content will be seeing it more frequently and have more opportunities to <strong>engage with it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; The customer experience <strong>feels more oppressive<\/strong> and controlled: customers feel like they are <strong>being watched and targeted<\/strong> (because they are), so they appreciate <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2018\/01\/ads-that-dont-overstep\">targeted campaigns that don&#8217;t overdo it <\/a>. You don&#8217;t want to go hitting your customer with six banner ads five minutes after they leave your site for the first time&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>You can try and balance the creepiness feeling it may still give, by adding in a bit of <strong>humour<\/strong> in.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 493px; height: 409px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG-CoPromote.png\" alt=\"humour add\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><em>CoPromote &#8211; facebook add<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>2- Virtual Reality<\/h2>\n<p>The second technology is the <strong>most fun<\/strong> way that customer experience is expanding, by incorporating <strong>virtual reality<\/strong> into the buying process. Companies are already looking for ways to <strong>enable customers to shop in virtual reality<\/strong>, whether it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/i-went-shoe-shopping-in-virtual-reality-1677715904\">trying on shoes<\/a> or glasses all the way to\u00a0creating a replica of a totally customized car before the buyer makes the purchase.<\/p>\n<p>It \u2018s only a matter of time before VR trials <strong>become the norm<\/strong> of prior to <strong>purchase habits<\/strong>. While you probably aren&#8217;t ready to start offering VR options to your customers, it\u2019s still good to be aware of this trend because<strong> it shows a shift <\/strong>in how customers are purchasing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG-virtual-reality-scaled-1.jpg\" alt=\"virtual reality\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Customers are growing into the expectation of being able to &#8220;<strong>try before they buy<\/strong>&#8220;, so offering &#8220;<strong>free returns<\/strong>&#8221; on products or simply <strong>making more room<\/strong> in your store locations for them to try your products, is already a great way to improve the CX of your customers (at least until you can afford VR).<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Discover more about\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/why-customer-experience-starts-with-customer-knowledge\/\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Why Customer Experience Starts with Customer Knowledge.<\/span><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Technology is only getting <strong>smarter <\/strong>and it&#8217;s leading to great progression for companies and customers alike. The best way forward, is to <strong>embrace<\/strong> what it has to offer to you and do what you can with the resources you have. Your customers will appreciate (and expect) no less.<\/p>\n<h2>3- Smart surveys<\/h2>\n<p>A way that companies with less AI capabilities are able to do this, is by investing in <strong>smart surveys<\/strong>. The technology of <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/surveys-improve-customer-experience\/\">smart surveys<\/a> has grown exponentially in the last five years, and they are enabling companies to offer a more <strong>interactive, personalized customer experience<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Smart surveys ask <strong>relevant questions<\/strong> to a customer base, that will allow the company to take the <strong>emotional temperature<\/strong> of their followers and customers, but also <strong>shape the experience<\/strong> to their needs. This is <strong>a low-investment<\/strong>, <strong>highly effective<\/strong> way for companies to personalize their services and make the customer experience more communication and <strong>feedback orientated<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Read more about <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/surveys-improve-customer-experience\/\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">How to Use Surveys to Improve the Customer Experience.<\/span><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Smart surveys can be <strong>sent out for a variety of reasons<\/strong>, but a typical post-purchase survey might look like the following:<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Luxury-Shop-NPS2-EN-1.png\" alt=\"net promoter score\" \/><br \/>\n<em>Example of\u00a0 a Net Promoter Score &#8211; MyFeelBack<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"height: 650px; width: 540px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG-bohemian-product-survey.png\" alt=\"survey\" \/><br \/>\n<em>Example of a post purchase survey &#8211; MyFeelBack<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>4- Recommender Systems<\/h2>\n<p>The last technology that you need to be getting on board with, is another fancy piece of <strong>machine learning<\/strong> called <strong>recommender systems<\/strong>. In short, recommender systems is the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/article\/how-do-netflixs-algorithms-work-machine-learning-helps-to-predict-what-viewers-will-like\"> technology that allows Netflix <\/a>for instance to know exactly what movies to recommend to you.
