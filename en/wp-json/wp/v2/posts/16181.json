They simply fulfill different functions in the life of the young person and their customer journey, which is marked by multiple points of contact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stores remain this generations favorite place for pleasure and shopping, (47%) and represent a real point of attachment for nearly one in two young people. Next are e-commerce sites (18%) and Instagram (13%).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>E-commerce sites are nevertheless praised for the diversity of products, recurring promotions as well as the absence of displacement specific to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\"><strong>A conservative generation?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, we learned that young people consult brands website before purchase anything, even before viewing its social networks (Instagram and Facebook). This trend is all the more true for the 15-18 age group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, contrary to what one might think, young people, do not buy compulsively. The simple customer journey&nbsp; (intention and then purchase) is actually quite rare as 58% of young people choose to procrastinate, sometimes with the expectation of a promotion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And moreover, this form of conservatism is expressed even in their privileged relationship channels since three-quarters of 15-25 year olds want to receive information by mail (38%), then by SMS (26%).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\"><strong>The many advantages of e-commerce<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The key strengths of e-commerce are proving to be its availability, ease and abundant offers, it is no surprise that Amazon is quoted by 34% of young people as the website on which they prefer to do their purchases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Amazon is more cited by young men (38%, against 30% among women), Asos, conversely, seduced more women (21% of them against 15% of men).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should also be noted that it is also important for this generation to live an online experience, just as it can be experienced in stores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common uses in the customer journey&nbsp; for young people aged 15 to 25 is to seek advice online: 68% of young people in this target group often or always consult online reviews.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And indeed, when we ask young people what characterizes a good app or a good e-commerce site, one of the first points that emerge is the content of the reviews, followed by transparency, and sales and the promotions diversity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\"><strong>What is that strongly unties Generation Z\u2019s favorite e-commercants?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>These are mostly multi-brand marketplaces.<\/li><li>Affordable low prices are also an important point for this young generation.<\/li><li>Not to mention optimized delivery, very important in the displacement perspective.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/generation-z-customer-journey2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-32542\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stores are resisting<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the customer journey,&nbsp;in-store visits are very much so an opportunity to live an experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>30% of young people go to stores during outings with friends and 33% test products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This outing with friends then becomes an additional argument in favor of physical stores, and for the experience happening in the moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And logically, testing products becomes more of an asset to the stores for residents of Paris and the Paris region (41%) than for those living in the provinces (31%).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trying out articles of clothing is in the eyes of young people the main asset of the physical stores.
