But first, let\u2019s talk about indicators. We recommend combining classic engagement indicators (open and click rates, etc.) with business indicators. The combination of the two will enable you to effectively measure the performance of your email marketing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Indicators Measuring Your Contacts\u2019 Engagement&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These indicators allow to measure how receptive your recipients are to the messages you send them. Anyone in the business is familiar with these indicators:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Delivery rate: the percentage of emails delivered to your recipients\u2019 inbox, out of the total emails sent. <\/strong>This rate should be more than 98%. Any lower and you have a problem. Probably due to addresses that no longer exist. In this case, you need to clean your addresses. Unless some of your emails are being blocked by internet service providers (ISP)\u2026&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Open rate: the percentage of emails opened out of the total emails delivered<\/strong>. This rate largely depends on the quality of your subject. We\u2019ll come back to that later.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Response rate: the percentage of clickers among the openers<\/strong>. Out of 100 recipients who open the email, how many click on a link in the email? This rate reflects your recipients\u2019 interest in your email\u2019s content\u2026 and therefore how relevant your email marketing is.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Click rate: the number of recipients who click on the email compared to the number of emails delivered. <\/strong>The click rate reveals how many people clicked on one of the email links, among all those who received the email in their inbox. The click rate is not an easy KPI to analyse because it depends on a lot of factors. Marketing teams tend to focus on the open rate and response rate.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Unsubscribe rate: the number of recipients who received the email and decided to unsubscribe from the mailing list. <\/strong>It is generally agreed that the unsubscribe rate should not exceed 1%. Beyond that, it\u2019s probably a sign of poor marketing pressure management and a lack of relevant \/ targeted campaigns.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Indicators Measuring Email Marketing Performance&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The engagement indicators listed above aren\u2019t really Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs<\/strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 40% open rate doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that your email marketing campaign was successful. The real \u201cKPIs\u201d, in the strict sense of the term, are those that measure the campaign\u2019s \u201cbusiness\u201d performance. E.g.: sales on an ecommerce site generated by a campaign.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These indicators are more difficult to build because they require the implementation of tracking systems. They measure performance after the email has been clicked on. This is not available in traditional emailing software. Which is why not many companies use these business-centric indicators, despite them being <strong>the only ones that can measure ROI.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that <strong>a business indicator isn\u2019t necessarily a financial indicator<\/strong>. It\u2019s basically any indicator that measures how well your campaign has met your email marketing objectives.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take a specific example: you deploy a satisfaction survey by email. Your objective is to get as many responses as possible. The key indicator (KPI) will be the survey participation rate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another example: you send an email invitation to a webinar. In this case, the right KPI will be the number of people who sign up to the webinar, generated by email marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out how to write the perfect customer survey invitation email.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:36px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\">A Few Tips on Increasing Your Email Marketing Performance&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although email remains a key marketing channel, that generates ROI, lots of companies have poor results, low opening rates, insignificant click rates and, ultimately, unsatisfactory business indicators.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Email marketing is an art and just like any art, there are rules<\/strong>. We\u2019ll present them in more detail in another article, but here are a few tips to take your <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/industrie-transport\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">email marketing<\/a> to the next level.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#1 Measure Performance&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This tip links back to the first part of this article. Before trying to increase your performance, you need to <strong>measure it by building a monitoring system in your email software, office tool or BI tool<\/strong>\u2026 You can only improve what you measure. Incidentally, with BI tools, you can measure omnichannel performance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, your reports should include the engagement indicators above, but also business indicators whenever possible. Once again, business indicators are the true measure of email performance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#2 Segment Your Email Campaigns&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t send all your emails to all your contacts. <strong>Design your campaigns for specific segments<\/strong>. A contact segment is a group of contacts who share the same socio-demographic characteristics, buying behaviour, interests, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Segmenting contacts will enable you to target your campaigns on one or more specific segments. According to Campaign Monitor, marketers who segment their marketing campaigns see, on average, a 760% increase in revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#3 Create Mobile-Friendly Emails&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember these two figures:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>1 out of 5 email campaigns are not optimised for mobile devices. Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.superoffice.com\/blog\/b2b-email-marketing-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Super Office<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nearly 55% of global web traffic is generated by mobile devices. Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/277125\/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Statista<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to <strong>provide an enjoyable reading experience on mobile devices as well as computers<\/strong>. More than half of your emails will probably be opened on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2 tips:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use &#8220;responsive design&#8221; email templates. All those provided by modern emailing software are, in theory, responsive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Run tests to preview your emails on several different screen sizes. You can use software like Litmus to carry out these checks.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#4 Think Carefully About Your Email Subject&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The subject is the first thing your recipients see. <strong>Take your time to find an engaging subject<\/strong>, it\u2019s worth it. A poor subject = an email that isn\u2019t opened = an email that isn\u2019t read. Companies often don\u2019t spend long enough on the subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#5 Do A\/B Tests&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This links to the previous tip. We recommend testing different subjects. The idea is to send your email with subject A to half your list and an email with subject B to the other half. This enables to identify the best-performing subjects and to discover what gets the most reaction out of your audience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can then go one step further and extend these tests to other email parameters. For example, send-out times and email content. However, we recommend limiting your tests to one variable to facilitate the analysis of your results.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#6 Make Use of the Pre-Header&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The pre-header is the text that\u2019s displayed to the right of the subject in your inbox. The pre-header also impact the open rate. We recommend personalising it. You could write it as a continuation of the subject, like in the example below.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/e-mail-key-figures.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36674\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The pre-header should encourage recipients to click, like the subject, and give an idea of the email\u2019s content and value proposition.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#7 Aim for Hyper-Customisation&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyper-customisation is the ability to <strong>personalise all email parameters<\/strong>:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Greetings<\/strong>, by using the contact\u2019s first name and\/or last name. E.g.: \u201cHi Lena\u201d.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The content of the message, and in particular what you\u2019re offering<\/strong>. This customisation parameter is based on your campaign segmentation or behavioural variables in Marketing Automation scenarios (e.g. sending an abandoned cart reminder, presenting abandoned or similar products).&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Email send-out time.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Customisation is based on <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/cx-management-en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">customer knowledge<\/a><\/strong>. Which leads to our last tip: invest in customer knowledge! Skeepers has several customer knowledge solutions for you to discover.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, we can absolutely confirm that email marketing is not dead. In fact, it\u2019s more alive than ever. But to create email campaigns and scenarios that perform well, you need to apply a series of best practices. They\u2019re well-known and documented, but it\u2019s important to put them into practice.
