You must ensure that your customers repeat their purchases as often as possible.<br \/>\nSo, how can you encourage your customers to buy from you again after a first purchase? Discover 8 effective techniques.<\/p>\n<h2>1 \u2014 Offer Similar or Complementary Products<\/h2>\n<p>A lot of online retailers use cross-selling.<br \/>\nThis involves suggesting similar or complementary products to those your customers or website visitors have clicked on or added to their basket.<br \/>\nThis technique allows to increase the average basket value and can also be used to encourage repeat purchases.<br \/>\nFor example, <a href=\"https:\/\/asteria.one\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">asteria.one<\/a> uses <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.shopify.com\/recently-viewed-products\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shopify platform<\/a> to display the latest clicked-on products on their website:You can also send your customers emails with product suggestions that are similar to those they\u2019ve recently bought. This technique is based on a simple and intuitive principle. When you present customers with products that are linked to their previous purchases and that they are likely to be interested in, they are more likely to make a repeat purchase.<\/p>\n<h2>2 \u2014 Update Customers on New Products and Offers<\/h2>\n<p>Are you about to market a new product range? Are you offering a new service? Are you organising a commercial event (e.g., sales, etc.)?<br \/>\nEither way, it\u2019s important to keep your customers informed, by sending out a newsletter for example.<br \/>\nThis will ensure that your customers don\u2019t forget about you and maintain (or reawaken) customer interest in your brand.<\/p>\n<h2>3 \u2014 Send Personalised Offers<\/h2>\n<p>Newsletters are a &#8220;one-to-many\u201d marketing technique, although modern email software allows for greater personalisation (e.g., newsletters for men \/ newsletters for women).<br \/>\nBut the Holy Grail of digital marketing is the one-to-one approach, which consists of sending your customers personalised content and offers, based on their profile, purchases and interests.<br \/>\nAccording to a study, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wizishop.fr\/blog\/78-des-consommateurs-attendent-des-prix-et-promotions-personnalises-le-chiffre-du-jour.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">78% of consumers<\/a> expect personalised prices and special offers.<br \/>\nPersonalised offers are, by definition, far more likely to interest your customers, and therefore to trigger a purchase.<br \/>\nThese offers can be sent by email, SMS, on your mobile app (if you have one), or even directly via your website (in the form of a pop-up, for example).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Tips for increasing your campaign conversion rates: delivery incentives (e.g., free delivery), promotional codes or a sense of urgency (limited time offers).<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>4 \u2014 Provide Attractive Services<\/h2>\n<p>In e-commerce, it takes more than a pretty product catalogue to appeal to customers and encourage them to make repeat purchases.<br \/>\nYou also need to offer advantageous services.What makes you stand out from your competitors is not the products you sell, or your prices, but also and maybe above all, your different services.<\/p>\n<h2>5 \u2014 Mix Contact Channels<\/h2>\n<p>Companies often focus their communication and marketing on email. Which is a shame because <strong>there are so many other channels out there!<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The best way to make your communication more effective and impactful is to adopt a cross-channel approach: social media, SMS, website (chatbot), mobile app, etc.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This approach will enable you to reach your customers more easily and to encourage them to buy from you again.<\/p>\n<h2>6 \u2014 Send Satisfaction Surveys<\/h2>\n<p>This is probably the most important technique or strategy. Customer satisfaction is <strong>key to optimising your repeat purchase rate<\/strong>.<br \/>\nCustomer satisfaction is the first step towards loyalty, and therefore repeat purchaseq.<br \/>\n<strong>Sending <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/cx-management-en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">satisfaction surveys<\/a> allows to measure your customers\u2019 satisfaction levels, ensure that you\u2019re meeting your targets\u2019 needs and identify areas for improvement.<\/strong><br \/>\nYou can send survey invitations by email (e.g., Kiosquemag), as well as SMS, via your mobile app, website (pop-up), or even QR Codes. MyFeelBack enables you to manage and mix these different deployment channels.<\/p>\n<h2>7 \u2014 Setting up a Loyalty Programme<\/h2>\n<p>Building <strong>customer loyalty is key for getting your customers to buy from you again<\/strong>.<br \/>\nTo encourage the loyalty process, there is an old but still effective technique: loyalty programmes. With each purchase, the customer cumulates points that entitle them to benefits or discounts.<br \/>\nYou can also offer customers who sign up to your programme priority services.<br \/>\nMost online retail software includes features to set up and manage these kinds of programmes.<\/p>\n<h2>8 \u2014 Build a Good Customer Relationship<\/h2>\n<p>In e-commerce, the customer relationship is very important.<\/p>\n<p>A good<strong> customer relationship strengthens the link between your brand and customers<\/strong>, creates a relationship of trust, and develops your customers\u2019 interest in your products or services.<\/p>\n<p>On the flip side, a bad customer relationship will result in your customers turning away.<\/p>\n<p>If you want customers to come back and repeat their purchases, then make sure to <strong>provide a considerate, attentive, personalised, responsive and professional customer service<\/strong>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>8 Techniques to Encourage Repeat Customer Purchases August 26, 2021 8 Techniques to Encourage Repeat Customer Purchases August 26, 2021 If you\u2019re an online retailer, acquiring new customers shouldn\u2019t be your only goal.
