We created MyFeelBack to meet the rising challenges relating to customer knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>We continually work to enhance our solution, in order to evolve with our clients\u2019 needs and new customer experience monitoring technologies. Design customisation, expansion of deployment channels, integration of collected data into your business tools &#8211; discover all of MyFeelBack\u2019s latest features.<\/p>\n<h2>A conversational format for even more effective surveys<\/h2>\n<p>MyFeelBack\u2019s surveys can be deployed on all the main marketing channels; websites, email, SMS, mobile apps, social media, etc. You can thus <strong>adapt the channel according to your surveys\u2019 targeted profiles<\/strong>, and your customers\u2019 preferences. Implementing conversational technology will enable you to adapt your Customer Relationship to evolving customer behaviours. It is estimated that <strong>the average response rate to a chat survey is around\u2026 75%<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p>You can now deploy your surveys via chat tools (WhatsApp, Messenger, WeChat, etc.), using the <strong>conversational API<\/strong> that we provide.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 660px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/myfeelback-platform-api-1.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This API enables customer services to send surveys at the beginning or end of a conversation. Some examples? Here are two use cases:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Measuring customer satisfaction<\/strong> following an interaction with a customer service agent.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engaging dialogue<\/strong> with your website visitors via the chat module.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 285px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/myfeelback-nouveautes-2019-integrations2.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/h2>\n<h2>Strengthening the integration of MyFeelBack into your digital ecosystem<\/h2>\n<p>MyFeelBack enables you to collect qualified information about your customers. This information is then fed into your various business tools; CRM, Marketing Automation, customer relations tools, etc. And helps you transform your collected data to generate business value.<\/p>\n<p>To facilitate the integration of MyFeelBack into your digital ecosystem, we have developed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Webhooks<\/strong>. A webhook sends information collected via a survey to a third party application of your choice, in order to trigger specific actions. For example: publishing a message on Slack as soon as a customer responds to your survey. Webhooks ensure the integration of MyFeelBack into your activation tools, without you having to use the API. We offer webhooks with Slack, Google Sheets, Excel, Adobe Campaign, Salesforce, Oracle, SendinBlue and since the end of 2019, <a href=\"https:\/\/freshdesk.com\/fr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Freshdesk<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 225px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/myfeelback-platform-webhooks.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Native connectors<\/strong> that automatically send answers to MyFeelBack surveys\u00a0 to your applications, to the location of your choice (customer account for example), using the \u201cmapping\u201d technique. MyFeelBack has developed connectors with the main tools on the market; Hubspot, Microsoft Dynamics, Adobe Campaign, Zendesk\u2026 and Salesforce Marketing Cloud since 2019.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Discover all the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfeelback.com\/en\/integrations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MyFeelBack integration tools<\/a> (native connectors &amp; webhooks)<\/p>\n<h2>100% customisable surveys to reflect your brand identity<\/h2>\n<p>Since 2019, you can customise your MyFeelBack surveys down to the very last detail, to adapt them to your brand identity.<\/p>\n<p>You can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create <strong>design templates<\/strong> and associate them to your various campaigns. Templates save time; you do not have to start from scratch, the visual design is pre-configured, so you only have to customise your surveys\u2019 content. The use of templates also gives greater visual consistency to your various campaigns and deployments.<\/li>\n<li>Create <strong>rating scales with customised icons<\/strong> to surprise your customers, catch their attention and make your surveys irresistible!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 388px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/myfeelback-platform-design.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <strong>100% customised colour schemes<\/strong> to adapt the colour of your surveys to your style guide and corporate identity. You can also use colour gradients.<\/li>\n<li>Customise the <strong>CTA (\u201ccall to action\u201d) buttons, floating bars and pop-up windows<\/strong>, to improve the visibility of surveys deployed on your website.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Customised dashboards<\/h2>\n<p>To facilitate the analysis and management of collected data, MyFeelBack has developed a new functionality for <strong>customised dashboards<\/strong>, which will shortly be available on your account. This will enable you to easily build and adapt your decision-making dashboards according to your objectives and needs. They will be automatically updated for real time performance monitoring!<\/p>\n<p>The innovations made to our platform all share one goal; to help you improve your overall customer experience. Now you too can deploy new business opportunities through customer knowledge!<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-bc1c1802-5810-4731-ab3f-b6a86c0c8b16\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-bc1c1802-5810-4731-ab3f-b6a86c0c8b16\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-bc1c1802-5810-4731-ab3f-b6a86c0c8b16\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/bc1c1802-5810-4731-ab3f-b6a86c0c8b16\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-bc1c1802-5810-4731-ab3f-b6a86c0c8b16\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/bc1c1802-5810-4731-ab3f-b6a86c0c8b16.png\" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" \/><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'bc1c1802-5810-4731-ab3f-b6a86c0c8b16', {}); \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>80% of companies are lacking information about their customers.
