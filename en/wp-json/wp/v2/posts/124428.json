If you\u2019ve ever made a purchasing decision based on customer reviews you read, you\u2019ve proven that point. Text reviews on eCommerce sites are one of the most powerful forms of social proof for brands today and can help rake in some serious cash. As a result, reviews are becoming more of a focus for brands of all sizes and are slowly but surely seeping into influencer campaign deliverable lists.<\/p>\n<p>What is social proof?<\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell, social proof is the idea that people will follow actions en masse. Think of trends and the ripple effect that comes with them. People will do anything if they see enough other people doing it.<\/p>\n<p>Why are eCommerce reviews and customer testimonials such valuable social proof?<\/p>\n<p>Just like influencer marketing, a big reason as to why eCommerce reviews are so valuable is because they\u2019re not created by brands. Today\u2019s savvy shoppers find comfort and reassurance when they can read about the experiences of those who actually tried the product, and better yet, those who aren\u2019t obligated to give it a 5-star rating. This is especially valuable for shoppers who cannot test a product in-store, as eCommerce reviews are one of the only ways they can get a \u201cfeel\u201d for a product.<\/p>\n<p>How can eCommerce reviews increase sales?<\/p>\n<p>More reviews means more sales. Even just adding a single review to a product page can <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.3dcart.com\/blog\/product-reviews-increase-sales\">increase orders by 10%<\/a>. That percentage climbs higher as more reviews are added (200 reviews can lead to a 44% lift). There is a high correlation between the number of product reviews and eCommerce conversion rates.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond item-specific conversion rates, eCommerce reviews also impact site traffic because of their effect on a site\u2019s SEO. Once published, eCommerce reviews can appear on the first page of a Google search for products or for the brand itself. By having eCommerce reviews rank on the first page of all of the major search engines, you can better catch the attention of people who find your brand through organic search and move those customers down your marketing funnel to make a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, showing that a sizable amount of people found your product to deliver on its promises entices new customers to press \u201cadd to cart.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Using eCommerce reviews in influencer campaigns<\/p>\n<p>Not every brand can shell out big bucks for macro influencers to feature their product in an Instagram post, only to drive a spike or two in sales. Reviews, from a deliverable standpoint, are lower lift (meaning they cost less to produce than say, a video or photo) and they are also far less ephemeral than a post in someone\u2019s feed that\u2019s out of sight once \u201crefresh\u201d is hit. These qualities\u2013and the fact that they increase sales\u2013make them an attractive addition to influencer campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>When requesting eCommerce reviews from influencers of any follower count, remember to comply with all <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2019\/10\/22\/us\/sunday-riley-fake-reviews-trnd\/index.html\">FTC regulations<\/a> and encourage authentic feedback. Remember, social proof is most effective when it\u2019s real.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Request a Demo<\/h2>\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_6  et_pb_text_align_justified et_pb_bg_layout_light\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>Octoly makes it easy for brands to build authentic text reviews and amazing influencer content with product seeding campaigns at scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Related Articles<\/h2>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s no secret that people are influenced by the opinions of others.
