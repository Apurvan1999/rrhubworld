With many growing tired of traditional advertisements, it\u2019s time for brands to get more creative in order to connect with a new generation of customers. That\u2019s where UGC content comes in. In fact, consumers are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20190220005302\/en\/Stackla-Survey-Reveals-Disconnect-Content-Consumers-Marketers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.4 times more likely to view user-generated content as authentic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> compared to content created by brands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incorporating UGC content into your advertisements can be a valuable tool in leveling up your efforts, allowing you to fully utilize the beautiful and authentic content that micro and macro-influencers can provide. With the content already at your fingertips, here are the best practices around using influencer UGC in your social media ads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Find the Right Influencers<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re looking to use UGC content as paid advertising, the first step is ensuring the content aligns with your brand\u2019s values and mission. This comes from building relationships with trustworthy and high-quality influencers. While you could spend days scanning the internet for content creators, Octoly can help to connect you with unique influencers that are right for you, manage gifting distribution, and allow you to sit back and watch the UGC roll in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Credit Creators<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When using Octoly, brands have the right to re-purpose the images created by Octoly\u2019s influencers for digital marketing. Without this agreement in place, it\u2019s best practice to reach out to the user whose content you\u2019re interested in reusing and crediting them in the post. That way, you avoid damaging a relationship with an influencer or customer and the brand comes off as collaborative and responsible to your audience. It\u2019s a win-win. <\/span><\/p>\n<ol><\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Match the Content With the Platform<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re wanting your UGC advertisement to blend into the platform authentically, it\u2019s important to pick the right platform depending on the content. For TikTok, this means video format and making the most of the latest TikTok trends. If your UGC isn\u2019t trend-specific, try adding the most popular song of the moment as the soundtrack to ensure your brand comes across as relevant. For Facebook and Instagram, this could look like a carousel ad of a set of UGC content and should include tailoring to the right custom audiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@sofinaaaaa\/video\/6885713272641703174\" data-video-id=\"6885713272641703174\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\" >\n<section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@sofinaaaaa\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@sofinaaaaa?refer=embed\">@sofinaaaaa<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>My must-have for the past 3 years\ud83c\udf1e <a title=\"isleofparadisegiftedme\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/isleofparadisegiftedme?refer=embed\">#isleofparadisegiftedme<\/a> @theisleofparadise <a title=\"isleofparadise\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/isleofparadise?refer=embed\">#isleofparadise<\/a> <a title=\"ownyourglow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/ownyourglow?refer=embed\">#ownyourglow<\/a> @sephora<\/p>\n<p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\u266c Put Your Records On - Ritt Momney\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/music\/Put-Your-Records-On-6815868828203878402?refer=embed\">\u266c Put Your Records On &#8211; Ritt Momney<\/a> <\/section>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p> <script async src=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/embed.js\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Octoly&#8217;s client Isle of Paradise re-used content from their TikTok campaign for their ads on the platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Tell Your Audience What content You Want<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best part about using UGC content is the opportunity to inspire more UGC content (and therefore free advertising). When coming up with your social media campaign, consider how you can get your audience more involved. This could be asking them a question, creating a social competition, or using the photo or video as a callout for them to respond. Whatever it is, this creates a cycle of more content to utilize, saving you the time and expense of professional shoots. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Request a Demo<\/h2>\n<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_6  et_pb_text_align_justified et_pb_bg_layout_light\">\n<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>Octoly makes it easy for brands to build authentic text reviews and amazing influencer content with product seeding campaigns at scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Related Articles<\/h2>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0Here\u2019s how to utilize influencer UGC in your next social media ad campaign.\u00a0 There\u2019s no denying that social media has changed the way we consume ads.
