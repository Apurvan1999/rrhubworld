Customer knowledge is key to performance marketing. If you know what your customers like, expect and need, you can better target your products and services, and personalise your messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, now you\u2019re looking for ideas on how to achieve your customer knowledge goals. You\u2019re probably wondering, how can I develop my customer knowledge? How can I better qualify my existing and target customers?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look no further! Here are three simple and effective ideas to build or optimise your strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\"><strong>1&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;Analyse Your Market and Target Customers<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies seek to position themselves on a market and acquire market shares. A market includes all the individuals (B2C) or businesses (B2B) to whom your products and services are addressed. These individuals or businesses are all potential customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It\u2019s important to have detailed knowledge of the market in which you operate<\/strong>. If you\u2019re in the process of setting up a company, then you need to acquire this knowledge before launching your business. And if you\u2019re an established company, you need stay up to date with market developments and trends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"market-research-a-tool-to-analyse-your-market\"><strong>Market Research: A Tool to Analyse Your Market&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Market research<\/strong>&nbsp;is a classic tool to understand a company\u2019s target market. This tool is not only for businesses in the process of being created. Market research is useful at any stage of a company\u2019s life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Market research is a good way of&nbsp;<strong>getting to know your customers better<\/strong>, keeping up to date with new trends or finding out about changes in consumer habits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Market research can take on different forms. In the past, studies were carried out by external institutes. They would analyse the available statistics and interview consumer panels to produce an overview of the market, both in terms of supply and demand. But times have changed and there are other possibilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alternatives-to-classic-market-studies\"><strong>Alternatives to Classic Market Studies<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Information has become easy to access with the Internet. Companies with a limited budget can study the market on their own, by reading studies that have already been produced by research firms, such as Xerfi or Euroostaf\u2026&nbsp;<u>INSEE<\/u>&nbsp;also publishes very interesting information about different industries. Not to mention the general or specialised press that regularly publishes various studies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><p>Another alternative is to&nbsp;<strong>set up your own consumer panel<\/strong>&nbsp;and to survey your target customers. There are several ways to constitute your own panel. You could use a solution such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/es\/cx-management-es\/\">Skeepers CX Management<\/a>&nbsp;to deploy surveys to target customers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-experience-management.jpg\" alt=\"customers satisfaction\" class=\"wp-image-22192\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u00a0<\/h2>\n<h2 id=\"chap2\"><strong>2\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Analyse Your CRM Customer Data<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer knowledge generally refers to existing customers. Which makes sense. It\u2019s more important to know your customers than consumers in general.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get to know your customers better, you need to analyse the data you have on them. Customer knowledge encompasses all your customer data. So, where is your customer data stored? That\u2019s the key question!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"customer-knowledge-implies-centralised-customer-data\"><strong>Customer Knowledge Implies Centralised Customer Data<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are basically two types of businesses:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Companies that have centralised all their customer data in a master database: usually CRM software or an alternative technology serving as a customer repository: a Data Warehouse, Customer Data Platform, etc.<\/li><li>Companies with customer data distributed in several tools and information system tools.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re the second type of company, the main challenge is to unify your customer data in a centralised base. Data unification is a prerequisite of customer knowledge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-three-main-categories-of-customer-data\"><strong>The Three Main Categories of Customer Data<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re the first type of company, then you should take the time to&nbsp;<strong>analyse your existing data<\/strong>. You can learn a lot about your customers by analysing the data stored in your base. If your base (e.g., your CRM) is sufficiently rich, you already have access to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customer sociodemographic data\u00a0<\/strong>(sex, age, geographical location, earnings, etc.). This data can help you identify who your customers are.<\/li>\n<li>Your customers\u2019 interests, values, passions, preferences\u2026 This is known as \u201c<strong>psychographic\u201d data<\/strong>. This data tells you what your customers like and think.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Behavioural data<\/strong>, i.e., all the data that tells you about your customers\u2019 behaviour on different channels (web behaviour, email behaviour, etc.) and their reaction to your solicitations. This category of data plays an important role in marketing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-22198\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-knowledge-2.jpg\" alt=\"customers satisfaction\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\"><strong>3 \u2014 Enrich Your Customers Satisfaction and Knowledge With Surveys<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your database doesn\u2019t have all the data you need to fully understand your customers, their expectations and their needs. Your CRM only gives you access to data that you\u2019ve already collected or extracted. You need to enrich this data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-best-tool-to-enrich-customer-data-surveys\"><strong>The Best Tool to Enrich Customer Data? Surveys<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To finetune your customer knowledge, you need to enrich your CRM data. There are several tools and techniques available. Let\u2019s take a closer look at one of these tools that you\u2019ve probably already heard of\u2026&nbsp;<strong>customer surveys<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to better understand your customers\u2019 motivations, needs and preferences to offer them more targeted products and services? Then why not simply ask your customers for the information you need to improve their brand experience?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"two-survey-categories-to-enrich-your-customer-knowledge\"><strong>Two Survey Categories to Enrich Your Customer Knowledge<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several types of surveys that can be grouped into two main categories:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nimble.com\/blog\/benefits-from-using-customer-satisfaction-surveys\/\"><strong>Satisfaction surveys<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0sent to customers to measure their overall satisfaction levels or with regards to precise items after an interaction: an online or in-store purchase, a delivery, contact with customer services, etc. Satisfaction surveys enable you to evaluate your customers\u2019 experience. You can also add one or two customer knowledge questions to these surveys.<\/li>\n<li><strong>\u201cCustomer knowledge\u201d or \u201cqualification\u201d surveys<\/strong>, which aim to collect additional information about your customers. These surveys are often titled something like, \u201clet\u2019s get to know each other better\u201d or \u201ctell us more about yourself\u201d. \u201cQuiz marketing\u201d style surveys also fit into this category.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-22199\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-questionary.jpg\" alt=\"customers satisfaction\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"targeted-surveys-to-be-deployed-on-all-your-channels\"><strong>Targeted Surveys to be Deployed on All Your Channels<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern customer knowledge solutions, such as Skeepers, enable you to edit and&nbsp;<strong>deploy surveys on the channel(s) of your choice<\/strong>: email, website, mobile, social media, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can target your surveys by defining:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The customers you want to send your survey to.<\/li><li>The conditions for triggering the survey. For example, you can trigger a survey according to a customer\u2019s behaviour on your website: pages visited, duration, mouse movements, etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"integrating-your-survey-data-into-your-crm-tool\"><strong>Integrating Your Survey Data Into Your CRM Tool<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Skeepers CX Management enables you to analyse your survey responses via a custom dashboard. But the challenge is to&nbsp;<strong>synchronise this new data with your customer base<\/strong>, in your customer relations management software or marketing and customer service tools. Which is why we\u2019ve developed several connectors with the main market CRM \u2013 CDP solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s recap<\/strong>! Here are 3 areas to work on to build an efficient customer knowledge strategy:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Idea 1: Start by getting to know your market and target clientele.<\/li><li>Idea 2: Analyse the data in your customer base (your CRM) to transform this data into actionable information for your marketing and customer relations operations.<\/li><li>Idea 3: Enrich the data in your customer database by deploying satisfaction and qualification surveys to your existing customers, at key moments of their customer journey.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\" id=\"hs-cta-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/20304540\/cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" height=\"159\" width=\"700\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a.png\" alt=\"Discover our Solutions: Book your Demo\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(20304540, 'cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a', {\"useNewLoader\":\"true\",\"region\":\"na1\"}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You\u2019re right to want to get to know your customers better.
