Did you know that you can also take advantage of Christmas to get to know your customers better? Here are 5 tips to expand your customer knowledge during the end-of-year celebrations.<\/p>\n<h2>Ensure that visitors have found their Christmas gifts<\/h2>\n<p>Some customers won\u2019t find the Christmas gift they\u2019re looking for on your website. And that\u2019s fine. Bu why not simply send all your customers a survey asking them this simple question: \u201cDid you find what you were looking for?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If your customer\u2019s answer is \u201cno\u201d, is it because they didn\u2019t find what they wanted? As a result of stock issues, high prices, long delivery times\u2026 Or is your catalogue too complicated to navigate?<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 356px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/example-larousse-know-visitor-better.png\" alt=\"Pop-up survey \" \/><\/p>\n<p>To properly target your respondents, you can set up a pop-up for when visitors leave your website without making a purchase or abandon their basket.<\/p>\n<p>More generally speaking, this survey is a great opportunity to <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/you-need-a-customer-insights-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">find out more about your customers\u2019 expectations, needs<\/a>, what they think about your pricing, delivery service, catalogue, services or customer journey.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Discover <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/christmas-predict-sales-ecommerce\/\">How Customer Knowledge Helps Predict Sales<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Offer Christmas promotions in exchange for completed surveys<\/h2>\n<p>Internet users love special offers, especially around Christmas<strong>.<\/strong> A lot of online retailers are aware of this and look to boost their Christmas sales with promotions, even if this eats into their already low margins. To be truly profitable, an e-commerce promotional strategy needs to be carefully thought out.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 635px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG-PotteryBarn.png\" alt=\"Christmas promotions\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We recommend taking advantage of this craze for promotions, not only to acquire more customers, but also to <strong>get to know them better and find out more about them.<\/strong> There are probably some questions you\u2019ve never dared ask your customers before in a survey.<\/p>\n<p>If you offer customers a special deal (with a promotional code for example) in exchange for completing your survey, there\u2019s a good chance they will agree to take part and answer all of your questions. Customers are on the lookout for good deals at Christmas and tend to be more open to answering questions.<\/p>\n<h2>Give your customers a better service for Christmas<\/h2>\n<p>Your company must constantly adapt to changing consumer behaviours and market developments. A \u201csuccessful\u201d company is one that constantly changes in order to adapt, that takes a continuous improvement approach.<\/p>\n<p>Why not ask your customers to help you <strong>identify areas of improvement for your company?<\/strong> It\u2019s almost Christmas. You\u2019d like to give them a present \u2013 to make your company, products and services even better and more efficient for the coming year. Ask your customers, through a survey with a well-written introduction, what changes they would like to see in your company.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 396px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/christmas-survey.jpg\" alt=\"Know your customers better \" \/><\/p>\n<p>Show them that <strong>their opinion counts more than ever, and that you would like to satisfy them even more<\/strong>. This technique will also enable you to strengthen your customer relationship.<\/p>\n<h2>Send an email to visitors on your Christmas gift pages<\/h2>\n<p>New retargeting technologies allow to automatically send emails to users who visit your website or a certain page. The idea is to send an email to anyone who visits your Christmas gift page without buying anything.<\/p>\n<p>In this email, start by reminding them that they recently visited your online shop. Then, ask them to complete a survey, to help them make a choice. The aim is to provide them, at the end of the survey, with <strong>a list of products likely to be of interest, based on their answers.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 443px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/JustFab-EN-Optimized-1.gif\" alt=\"Customer survey to know needs and expectations \" \/><\/p>\n<p>This technique allows to improve sales and also find out more about your target\u2019s needs and expectations. It is also aimed at your customers, i.e. visitors who have already bought something on your website.<\/p>\n<h2>Add a Christmas question to your usual surveys<\/h2>\n<p>Why not add one or more Christmas-related questions to your traditional customer satisfaction surveys? You could ask which of your products they would like to see under the tree, which products are not part of your catalogue but that they would have liked to find, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Or simply ask them if they\u2019re thinking about doing any of their Christmas shopping on your website, what they think about your Christmas deals, your Christmas marketing campaigns, your website\u2019s \u201cChristmas\u201d theme, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Christmas is a great opportunity to find out more about your existing or potential customers, so don\u2019t miss out!<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-42915eec-7bc4-4026-898c-0c7750681168\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-42915eec-7bc4-4026-898c-0c7750681168\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-42915eec-7bc4-4026-898c-0c7750681168\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/42915eec-7bc4-4026-898c-0c7750681168\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-42915eec-7bc4-4026-898c-0c7750681168\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/42915eec-7bc4-4026-898c-0c7750681168-1.png\" alt=\"download\" \/><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n hbspt.cta.load(744484, '42915eec-7bc4-4026-898c-0c7750681168', {}); \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Christmas is a strategic period for the e-commerce sector, anticipated by online shops looking to maximise their end-of-year sales.
