Customer requirements are always changing, and keeping up with their needs &#8211; especially nowadays in our social media and mobile-ridden landscape \u2013 can present a big challenge.\u00a0 However, it is a challenge well worth the effort:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>55% of customers say easy access to information and support can make them fall in love with a brand.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>86% of customers are willing to pay up to 25% more for a better customer experience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>36% of customers will fall in love with a brand which is able to deliver personalized experiences \u2013 knowing what a customer has already purchased, what previous service issues they\u2019ve experienced, the ability to send timely and relevant communications.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Fortunately, feedback surveys have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to stay on top of your customers\u2019 changing needs. Here\u2019s why.<\/p>\n<h2>1) They broaden your customer knowledge<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/us\/en\/pages\/operations\/articles\/2013-global-contact-center-survey.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deloitte<\/a> reports that 62% of businesses now think having access to the right customer information, such as that gathered through feedback surveys, and using that information to create a meaningful customer experience is the only way to strengthen customer loyalty and establish a true mark of differentiation.<\/p>\n<p>Companies which regularly survey customers to understand their values and needs are more likely to come out ahead. Among their benefits, surveys show how customers view your offerings, provide insights into how you compare to your competitors and provide a clearer picture of your customers\u2019 changing needs and perceptions.<\/p>\n<p>Any business will tell you that knowing who your customers are\u00a0 &#8211; and not just on a superficial or demographic level &#8211; is fundamental for business success. In-depth customer knowledge gathered via feedback surveys is essential for the creation of a superior, relevant customer experience that <a href=\"https:\/\/strativity.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/2009-Customer-Experience-Consumer-Study.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improves not only retention and lead generation<\/a> but also bottom-line sales and revenue.<\/p>\n<h2>2) They show what your customers are doing<\/h2>\n<p>There is a good chance that your business interacts with customers across multiple channels \u2013 online, offline, via social media, etc.\u00a0 After all, omnichannel shopping experiences are pretty much the norm for customers today with <a href=\"http:\/\/d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net\/resources\/whitepapers\/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">87%<\/a> assuming it\u2019s a given they can do business with a company across multiple channels.<\/p>\n<p>And, of course, they expect that omnichannel experience to be seamless. Because if it isn\u2019t, they\u2019ll take their business elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, Aberdeen Group has found that companies with the strongest omnichannel customer engagement strategies retain an average of 89% of their customers, as compared to 33% for companies with weak omnichannel strategies. With those kinds of numbers in mind, it\u2019s imperative you have in place strategies for continuous omnichannel improvements which can be acted on immediately.<\/p>\n<p>Real-time customer feedback will make it easier for you to see which channels customers use most frequently, how often and when they switch channels, and what problems they are experiencing along the way, the knowledge you need to prevent any disruptions which may end up costing you.<\/p>\n<h2>3) They make it easier to segment your customers<\/h2>\n<p>Customer feedback provides you with a clearer overall picture of who your customers are: job title and function, industry, budget, unique needs. And if you have this information readily available, it will be a lot easier to sell to your customers.<\/p>\n<p>Segmenting target market groups into sub-categories allows you to more precisely tailor communication channels and key messages and provide more relevant products and services. The more specifically and precisely customers are segmented, the greater the chance you will connect with them. Of course, the stronger your connection is, the longer lasting your engagement will be.<\/p>\n<p>Surveys improve your ability to segment. Asking questions concerning their knowledge of specific products, how often they use the product and why, and what their thoughts are concerning a product\u2019s price or quality will give you a much better sense of how to manage your marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p>And keep in mind, whether you are <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/improving-customer-satisfaction-will-save-your-online-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an online start-up<\/a> or a brick-and-mortar small business, your ability to segment your customers will likely provide you with the competitive edge you need to be successful.\u00a0 When <a href=\"http:\/\/sqps.onstreamsecure.com\/origin\/multivu_archive\/ENR\/211845-Cox-Business-Pulse-on-Small-Business-Survey.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">92% of U.S. consumers<\/a> say they visit a small business at least once a week, overwhelmingly motivated to do so by the high level of customer service they receive from a small business, you better do everything you can to ensure you are delivering on their expectations!<\/p>\n<h2>One Simple Survey, Unbelievably Big Results<\/h2>\n<p>Strategic customer experience management is necessary for your business to survive and thrive in today\u2019s competitive marketplace. And, fortunately, ensuring your customers receive the highest quality of service doesn\u2019t have to be a herculean task.<\/p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/csat-nps-ces-right-metric-for-superior-cx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CSAT to NPS to CES<\/a>, there are a number of basic \u2013 but powerful \u2013 ways to survey and measure your customer experience. With careful monitoring and assessment of each customer interaction, your business can make sure it is delivering an experience that makes customers happy and ensures your long-term success.<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--> <a href=\"http:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7-1.png\" alt=\"Download Ebook How Top Fortune 500 Companies Increased Their Performance Using Customer Feedback\" \/><\/a> <\/span> <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n\n        hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7', {});\n    \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span> <!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Keeping the customers you already have is, without question, considerably less expensive than acquiring new ones.\u00a0 But the only way to keep your existing customers is to make sure they remain satisfied with your business, that you are delivering exactly what they want each and every time they come to you.
