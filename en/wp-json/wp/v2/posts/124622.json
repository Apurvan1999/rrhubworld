At the heart of this clothing and accessories brand are the thousands of Cabi Stylists who showcase and sell the brand\u2019s collections in a home setting, serving as a first touchpoint for customers. Cabi\u2019s target demographic is women aged 35-55 who are highly engaged on social media and looking for inspirational and sophisticated fashion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenge<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cabi faced two related challenges: discoverability and scalability. Increasing Brand Awareness with new audiences is a top priority for our 20-year old brand, says Eboni Hudson, Cabi\u2019s Director of Digital Marketing. Hudson\u2019s team hoped to make Cabi discoverable to a larger, as well as a younger and more diverse, group of influencers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to working with Octoly, Cabi had shifted away from gifting to influencers through a PR agency in favor of bringing that work in-house, with an eye toward building deep and direct relationships with creators. But Cabi\u2019s small influencer marketing team didn\u2019t have the bandwidth to do full-scale product seeding, limiting its focus to its ambassador program and existing influencer relationships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal was to reach a much wider group of influencers while continuing to develop strong connections. \u201cIn order to get really authentic storytelling, the influencer has to be fully engaged with the brand,\u201d says Hudson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Solution<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Octoly\u2019s platform has allowed Cabi to scale its influencer relationships in a smart and streamlined way. Through Octoly\u2019s app, Hudson\u2019s team easily keeps tabs on communication with creators, tracks gifting shipments, and accesses a library of rich and authentic user generated content \u2014 crucial tools that allow Cabi to work with a larger network of influencers, more efficiently. Hudson notes that Octoly has also enabled Cabi to avoid the faux pas of contacting influencers who don\u2019t accept gifted products and instead target only those who are excited to try out the brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Octoly has created a space where influencers can find and fall in love with Cabi. \u201cWhat I really love about Octoly is that it allows the influencers to discover us, explore us, and then say: This is a company I\u2019d be interested in working with,\u201d Hudson says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Results<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Cabi started using Octoly\u2019s platform, the number of influencers it works with has grown from 50 to 500. There\u2019s a \u201cviral community aspect\u201d to Octoly, Hudson says, noting that influencers are very engaged with each other on the platform and therefore boost brand exposure among their peers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That network effect has introduced Cabi to some of its most passionate creators. \u201cWhen you find that kind of brand enthusiast, that\u2019s where it supercharges your awareness,\u201d Hudson says. \u201cThey\u2019re not just mentioning your product \u2014 they\u2019re full-on telling your brand story.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with Octoly has also allowed Cabi to work with more women of color, which is an active priority for the brand. Reaching a younger cohort of creators has added variety to the ways that shoppers see Cabi\u2019s clothing styled on social media. \u201cIt definitely gives the brand a fresh, young look,\u201d says Hudson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">The results in 1 year<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Influencer&nbsp; Posts<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">546<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">REACH<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">7M<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Interactions<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">256K<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ENGAGEMENT<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">3.34%<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you find that kind of brand enthusiast, that\u2019s where it supercharges your awareness\u2026 They\u2019re not just mentioning your product \u2014 they\u2019re full-on telling your brand story<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eboni Hudson, Director of Digital Marketing at Cabi<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Related case studies<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Getting started is easy<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kickstart your Influencer Marketing Strategy Now<\/h3>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How Clothing Brand Cabi Used Octoly To Supercharge Brand Awareness And Find Its Most Enthusiastic Influencers Scaling Influencer Marketing and Boosting Brand Discoverability The Brand Cabi was founded in 2002 with the goal of providing women with a better way to shop and work.
