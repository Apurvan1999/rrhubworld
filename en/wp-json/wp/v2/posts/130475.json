Many popular brands are using influencer marketing to <strong>gain visibility<\/strong> on social networks and <strong>generate engagement<\/strong>. On the influencer market, the choice is huge for brands: <a href=\"\/en\/infographic-hivency-influencer-pyramid\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>from the web star to the smallest nano-influencer<\/span><\/strong><\/a><strong>,<\/strong> there is something to suit all tastes and budgets.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>The notoriety of <strong>macro-influencers (more than 100,000 followers)<\/strong> leads to believe that the engagement obtained during an influencer marketing campaign will be more important. However, micro-influencers, despite their <strong>smaller number of followers<\/strong> (5,000 to 100,000), <strong>have a multitude of advantages<\/strong> for premium brands to exploit.<\/p>\n<p>These brands are often <strong>reluctant to collaborate with less popular influencers<\/strong>, for fear of not reaching the right consumer target, but also and above all not getting a profitable marketing campaign. These persistent preconceived ideas are in fact <strong>opposite to reality<\/strong>. Micro-influencers, too often forgotten by premium brands with a singular universe, <strong>represent <\/strong><a href=\"\/en\/micro-influencers-todays-true-thought-leaders\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>a major asset to use<\/span><\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s why:<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 30px;\">1. <strong>Collaborate with a specific target expert&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A micro-influencer has a smaller community and thus <strong>reaches a limited and well-defined targe<\/strong>t. In 2021, the time of follower hunting is over. Indeed, <strong>the number of subscribers is not representative of the influencer&#8217;s community <\/strong>or of his notoriety. What determines the quality of his audience is <strong>the engagement rate obtained:<\/strong> the total number of &#8220;likes&#8221; + comments\/number of followers (to realize) on an average of several posts.<\/p>\n<p>The number ONE criterion for brands to find an influencer to collaborate with is not necessarily his number of followers, but rather <strong>the engagement of his community and the quality of his work<\/strong>. Moreover, let&#8217;s remember that an influencer with thousands of followers can <strong>turn out to be a <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/345854\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>fake influencer<\/span><\/strong> <\/a>who buys likes, comments, or subscribers, and sometimes <strong>publishes fake &#8220;sponsored&#8221; content<\/strong> to earn money and generate views.<\/p>\n<p>In general, micro-influencers are often <strong>specialized in a specific area <\/strong>that they are passionate about and <strong>want to share with their loyal followers<\/strong>, which gives them <strong>particular expertise<\/strong> and is a guarantee of high-quality work. <a href=\"\/en\/micro-influence-shouldnt-intimidate-you\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>Collaborating with a micro-influencer<\/span><\/strong><\/a> ensures that you will reach the desired target thanks to their <strong>niche community.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In addition, there is <strong>no correlation between the size of the community and the quality of the content provided <\/strong>(Instagram feed, TikTok videos&#8230;): micro-influencers are professionals who <strong>make partnerships in line with their audience and their personality<\/strong>. Very often, content creation is <strong>not their main activity<\/strong>. They are therefore more easily accessible and less solicited by companies, which makes it easier for premium brands <strong>to find collaborations and partnerships quickly.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. &nbsp; Small community, high engagement<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Unlike macro-influencers or all-stars who have a very large audience, <strong>micro-influencers have a smaller, but <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingdive.com\/press-release\/20181009-study-micro-influencers-generate-7x-more-engagement-on-instagram-than-infl-1\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>more engaged and active community<\/span><\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong> Indeed, this type of influencer has a lifestyle similar to their followers, which allows them to <strong>maintain a relationship of trust <\/strong>with their community, looking like a<strong> &#8220;virtual family&#8221;.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Micro-influencers <strong>regularly interact with their followers <\/strong>on different networks, which is more difficult to do for an influencer with a large community. This allows to establish <strong>a link of proximity and gives more credibility <\/strong>to micro-influencers perceived as natural and authentic. Thus, followers <strong>are more inclined to buy a product appreciated or recommended by a micro-influencer<\/strong> having this credibility with his community. On the other hand, the most popular influencers can sometimes <strong>arouse mistrust among their followers<\/strong> due to the multiple partnerships and the numerous products recommended every day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The luxury, <\/strong><a href=\"\/en\/fashion-brands-choose-the-right-social-media\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>fashion<\/span><\/strong><\/a><strong>, and beauty sectors are strongly increasing<\/strong> these last months, which can be explained by <strong>the importance of <\/strong><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><strong>self-care<\/strong><\/span><strong> and <\/strong><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><strong>body-positive<\/strong><\/span> put forward on networks focusing on aesthetics and visual aspects such as Instagram, Snapchat, or even TikTok. Many brands are looking for partnerships with <strong>influencers with whom consumers can identify <\/strong>and make sense of the brand&#8217;s DNA.

That&#8217;s why they are <strong>appreciated and desired by brands <\/strong>that want to <strong>put forward accessible content creators. <\/strong>They are more numerous and efficient: they reach <strong>an average <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingdive.com\/news\/instagram-influencer-engagement-hovers-near-all-time-lows-study-says\/558331\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>engagement rate of 6.3%<\/span><\/strong><\/a><strong> compared to 3.6% for influencers with 10,000 followers<\/strong>.&nbsp; This accessibility found in this type of influencer allows them to <strong>collaborate with any type of brand<\/strong>, from mid-range to high-end and brings them an interesting <strong>multi-range experience.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Moreover, micro-influencers collaborate with a brand <strong>they are really interested in<\/strong>, but also and especially if it is<strong> in adequacy with their audience<\/strong>. Particularly attached to their community, they are sensitive to partnerships that <strong>make sense to them and appeal to their followers.<\/strong> Micro-influencers prioritize this type of collaboration according to their content, their personality, and their taste. Indeed, they seek to <strong>promote products that they really like and use<\/strong> rather than making partnerships or challenges just to follow the latest trends and gain views.<\/p>\n<h2>4.&nbsp; Build a profitable collaboration with high ROI<\/h2>\n<p>Collaborating with a micro- or nano-influencer <strong>is lower investment and profitable for premium brands:<\/strong> this type of influencer easily accepts collaborations, <strong>including unpaid partnerships involving only a product delivery <\/strong>for example. As previously mentioned, the degree of credibility of a micro-influencer is such that they have a <strong>real power of prescription among their followers<\/strong>. This phenomenon has become stronger with the Covid-19 crisis, resulting in an isolation of the population, <strong>reinforcing the need to nurture relationships and interactions via social networks<\/strong>, especially with their favorite influencers. Influencers were able to <strong>build strong relationships <\/strong>with their followers during this period, making their influencer marketing campaigns even more profitable. It is estimated that over the last three months, <a href=\"https:\/\/digitalmarketinginstitute.com\/blog\/20-influencer-marketing-statistics-that-will-surprise-you#:~:text=Not%20only%20do%2049%25%20of,on%20Twitter%2C%20YouTube%20or%20Instagram.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span>40% of Internet users have made a purchase thanks to an influencer <\/span><\/strong><\/a><strong>after seeing it on social networks.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thus, <strong>high awareness and conversion efficiency do not necessarily go hand in hand<\/strong>.

Indeed, the money you save thanks to the minimized costs of campaigns can be <strong>a way to invest in several campaigns with different micro-influencers<\/strong> at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>They have a more limited reach due to their targeted community. Thus, multiplying collaborations can allow premium brands <strong>to widen the reached audience and multiply the communication platforms<\/strong>.
