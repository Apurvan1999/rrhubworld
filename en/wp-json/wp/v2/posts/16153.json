Facing increasing competition in the food sector, Cot\u00e9 Sushi engaged the services of Advalo <strong>to develop customer loyalty, increase purchase frequencies and acquire new customers<\/strong> through digital. Assessment acquired from 12 months of collaboration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Develop customer loyalty and increase purchase frequencies<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>By calling on Advalo, the C\u00f4t\u00e9 Sushi brand expressed interest in developing its customer knowledge and taking whatever actions deemed necessary to do so and increase average order value and purchase frequencies. Thanks to the Advalo platform, <strong>36% of the customer database was reconciled<\/strong> in terms of customers for whom the brand possessed a unified vision of their online and in-store customer journey.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This knowledge enabled the brand to set up a series of personalized campaigns, corresponding to the different types of customers. Through the reconciliation of its database, C\u00f4t\u00e9 Sushi was able to prepare different customer segments: depending on purchase temporality (weekends, evenings or at noon on weekdays), or simply buying habits. These segmentations were used to send customized and actionable campaigns to each of the brand&#8217;s customers, thereby significantly increasing conversion rates usually noted on classic campaigns without personalization.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, campaigns run with the Advalo individualized marketing platform are automated, which saved time and productivity for the C\u00f4t\u00e9 Sushi marketing teams. In 12 months of collaboration, the brand was able to generate <strong>1.2 million in incremental turnover<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Develop future best customer acquisition in new catchment areas<\/h5>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before the start of the collaboration, campaigns were conducted solely on the brand\u2019s existing customer base. Today, Advalo supports C\u00f4t\u00e9 Sushi in the growth of its business, by conducting acquisition campaigns in new catchment areas. Advalo\u2019s platform will ensure the brand more accurately targets profiles similar to its best customers, and those who may be interested in the opening of new restaurants.<\/p>\n<p>Cot\u00e9 Sushi can now address its customers and prospects wherever they are: email, SMS, Google search or even on social networks. Through improved customer knowledge, acquisition campaigns are better targeted and generate more value in the long term. &#8220;The Advalo platform is a solution that is intuitive, efficient and scalable, the results speak for themselves.\u201d -Emmanuel Taib, founder of C\u00f4t\u00e9 Sushi<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Discover the interview with Emmanuel Taib founding CEO of C\u00f4t\u00e9 Sushi.
