Powers\u2019 2015 North American Hotel Guest Satisfaction Index Survey, the company did well in many key segments, even taking top spot for satisfaction in the upscale category. And in this year\u2019s American Consumer Satisfaction Index, <\/span><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">the company scored better than the industry average of 75<\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyatt is one of America\u2019s oldest and best-known hotel chains, offering brand differentiation through various lodgings: Park Hyatt, offering residential and urban luxury, Grand Hyatt, designed for upscale holiday travelers, and Hyatt Regency, specializing in mid to large-scaled premium properties. In recent years, the company has also added Andaz, an upper-end boutique brand, and HYATT, providing smaller full-service hotels. Most recently, the company launched Hyatt Centric, aimed directly at younger travelers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the company\u2019s high satisfaction levels and its unusually high level of brand diversity, offering more brands that competitors of the same size, it stands out as a particularly successful business, begging the question: how does it do it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, the answer is pretty straightforward: at Hyatt, it\u2019s all about consumer input. Sara Kearney, Senior Vice President of brands <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hotelmanagement.net\/development\/hyatt-s-sara-kearney-talks-brand-positioning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has said<\/a> that, since 2008, the company has <em>\u201c<strong>focused on customer feedback in developing a brand<\/strong>. In effect, we learned how to design the hotel by responding to the needs of consumers as they described them to us.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\">A Five Star Digital Experience<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyatt has developed a solid online presence, making it easy for guests to communicate with the hotel. On the company\u2019s home page, guests can click the \u201c<em>What\u2019s on your mind?<\/em>\u201d box which takes users to a microsite built around a complete <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/7-kpis-to-measure-your-customer-experience-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">customer experience<\/a>: a Twitter plug-in, images of rooms and amenities, email commenting, links to social networks and YouTube content, and the company\u2019s booking engine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/hyatt-help-customer-feedback-1024x464.jpg\" alt=\"hyatt customer feedback website\" class=\"wp-image-19582\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyatt enables travelers to easily interact with them and find relevant information. In designing such a comprehensive digital experience, the company is better poised to push customer engagement, and <strong>collect customer feedback to continue refining and\/or creating experiences which provide real value to customers<\/strong>. And customers are responding to the company\u2019s efforts. This year, Hyatt ranks <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/business\/ct-travel-company-social-media-0324-biz-20150323-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">#1 in hotel-related Twitter engagement<\/a> and #8 in Facebook followers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">Millennial Marketing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyatt has been around since 1957, but data collection and analysis has helped the hotel chain better understand just how different today\u2019s guests are compared to those of previous generations. To remain relevant with today\u2019s Millennial consumers, <strong>the company has used data to rebrand some of its key locations<\/strong>, launching an extreme makeover to attract younger guests. After extensive research and evaluation of customer feedback, Hyatt has embarked on delivering a new brand of hotels called Hyatt Centric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyatt Centric, currently located in Chicago and Florida\u2019s South Beach &#8211; with additional locations in New York, San Francisco, and Paris having already been announced &#8211; is targeted at younger consumers who normally use AirBnB because they prefer city-centered locations and the residential feel of an apartment or home. Among its Millennial-friendly features, Hyatt Centric offers seamless digital capabilities, pet-friendly rooms, and a fitness center. Guests can curl up in the \u201c<em>library<\/em>\u201d in a place called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hyatt.com\/en-US\/brands\/hyatt-centric\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Corner<\/a>, or socialize in the bar which promises locally inspired entrees, artisanal cocktails, and live music. From the food to the artwork and furniture, each location is designed with local authenticity in mind, helping travelers more easily transition into their new environs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\">Customer Centric Brand Development with customer feedback<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hyatt Centric name was inspired by the brand\u2019s mission to put the guest at the center of its city locations. But <strong>the customer has also been firmly situated at the center of all branding choices<\/strong>, increasing Hyatt Centric\u2019s value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyatt Centric has been, from the start, customer centric because it looked at customer needs from the customer\u2019s point-of-view. By stepping into the customers\u2019 shoes, the company was able to do two things: <strong>gather rich data on guests\u2019 preferences and behaviors<\/strong>, and <strong>create smart segments that go beyond basic demographics<\/strong>. Forward-thinking analytics helped Hyatt Centric not only identify its best customers across an array of channels, from demographics to preferences and trends, but also understand their behaviors, habits, and interests. As CEO Mark Hoplamazain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hotelnewsnow.com\/articles\/24948\/Hyatt-unveils-Centric-to-fill-lifestyle-void\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said earlier this year<\/a>, \u201c<em>The process we followed to create this new brand is something that has worked really well for us over the last several years. It requires very intensive engagement with owners, developers, partners, our team members of course, and maybe most critically, guests \u2013 lots of guests.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-321b1306-bd2d-4e2d-8ffc-8620e7b5f807\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-321b1306-bd2d-4e2d-8ffc-8620e7b5f807\" id=\"hs-cta-321b1306-bd2d-4e2d-8ffc-8620e7b5f807\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/20304540\/321b1306-bd2d-4e2d-8ffc-8620e7b5f807\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-321b1306-bd2d-4e2d-8ffc-8620e7b5f807\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" height=\"231\" width=\"700\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/321b1306-bd2d-4e2d-8ffc-8620e7b5f807.png\" alt=\"Memo 10 Ideas of Smart Questionnaires to Deploy on Your Website\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(20304540, '321b1306-bd2d-4e2d-8ffc-8620e7b5f807', {\"useNewLoader\":\"true\",\"region\":\"na1\"}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Customer satisfaction with Hyatt Hotels Corporation is high, thanks to customer feedback.&nbsp; According to J.D.
