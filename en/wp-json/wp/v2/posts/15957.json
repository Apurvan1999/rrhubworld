This becomes problematic if a customer&#8217;s privacy is compromised.<\/p>\n<h2>Where&#8217;s the limit, in order to respect your customers?<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s a fine line when it comes to big data and marketing intelligence, which makes it a difficult topic to tackle sometimes.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Everyone has a <strong>different level of comfort<\/strong> when it comes to privacy and perceived invasion, but every company also has a different approach to collecting and analyzing customer data.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What&#8217;s certain is that the line does get blured and crossed at times, as is demonstrated by the infamous <a href=\"http:\/\/searchcloudapplications.techtarget.com\/feature\/Big-data-collection-efforts-spark-an-information-ethics-debate\">Target Corp. scandal<\/a>, where an analytics program revealed a teenager&#8217;s pregnancy to her family.<\/p>\n<p>Often, the technology we rely on to <strong>gather information<\/strong> on our customers can get somewhat out of our control, because it is partially or fully<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/marketing-automation-information\">automated.<\/a> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This means you can&#8217;t exclude that some mistakes can occur, and therefore, it&#8217;s normal that <strong>ethical questions arise.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It can be difficult to obtain a <strong>customer&#8217;s permission<\/strong> to track their online movement. While <strong>internet users are aware<\/strong> by now that very little existing information on the web is actually private, users want to have <strong>some form of control <\/strong>over who is seeing their online movement and preferences.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-permission.jpg\" alt=\"customer-permission\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is why highly <strong>targeted ads<\/strong> that appear on a user&#8217;s screen can be so <strong>unsettling<\/strong>. For example, a user searches google for shoes and then sees an advertisement for a shoe company ten minutes later, on a <strong>completely different website<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In today&#8217;s era, customers are mostly used to these type of things happening, but <strong>it doesn&#8217;t make it any more comfortable<\/strong> and serves as a reminder that every information shared, is being memorised and used out there.<\/p>\n<p>You must <strong>keep in mind<\/strong> that most customers don&#8217;t really understand how the whole marketing machinery works behind the scenes, this is what makes it <strong>a bit &#8220;scary&#8221;<\/strong> to them and can lead them to be <strong>reluctant<\/strong> in sharing their information.<\/p>\n<p>Someone who <strong>doesn&#8217;t understand<\/strong> what&#8217;s being done with their information, or why, will automatically question if what they&#8217;re getting is worth what they&#8217;re giving. A lack of knowledge will potentially <strong>blur their judgment<\/strong>, so when you want to collect information, make sure they understand how this is actually going to<strong>\u00a0help them<\/strong>\u00a0get a better customer experience.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Discover more <span style=\"color: #ff0000\">: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/bad-marketing-habits\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000\">5 Bad Marketing Habits You Need to Ditch Now<\/span><\/a><span style=\"color: #ff0000\">.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>The secret to collect data: Dirty Marketing vs. Permission Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes the issue isn&#8217;t necessarily privacy, but <strong>unfair treatment<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, when Orbitz <a href=\"http:\/\/searchcloudapplications.techtarget.com\/feature\/Big-data-collection-efforts-spark-an-information-ethics-debate\">used their analytics results<\/a> to determine that, because Apple computer users tended to spend more on airline tickets, they could show them <strong>higher prices<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>These types of discriminations bring up <strong>new ethical questions<\/strong>,<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>as society gets used to the internet and big data.<\/p>\n<p>How do companies determine <strong>what quantifies &#8220;dirty&#8221; marketing<\/strong>, and how can they avoid it? Asking for <strong>permission<\/strong> is definitely a determining aspect in marketing.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http:\/\/sethgodin.typepad.com\/seths_blog\/2008\/01\/permission-mark.html\">Permission marketing<\/a> is the idea that marketing works best when the visitor or customer has given permission to be marketed to.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This might sound too good to be true, but actually,\u00a0many online users do <strong>voluntarily give out their email <\/strong>address in order to access information they<strong> find relevant<\/strong>, such as to access an<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cio.com\/article\/2867406\/marketing\/how-to-use-ebooks-to-improve-your-content-marketing-strategy.html\"> Ebook download<\/a> or to join a mailing list with content that interests them.<\/p>\n<p>Getting someone&#8217;s permission does two things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It helps to curtail the ethical &#8220;big data&#8221; issue discussed above<\/li>\n<li>It makes the recipient of the marketing campaign<strong> more receptive to the content<\/strong> and more likely to pay attention to the campaign, since visitors then feel like they freely chose to participate in it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with the concept\u00a0<em>The 4Cs of Trust,\u00a0<\/em>\u00a0you know that Choice is one of the pillars alongside control, commitment and compensation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-trust.jpg\" alt=\"customer-trust\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Allowing customers to direct what they are comfortable in sharing is\u00a0not only about playing it safe, it&#8217;s a requirement if you want them to <strong>trust<\/strong> you.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you&#8217;ve been living under a rock lately, you&#8217;ve heard about the EU General Data Protection Regulation (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eugdpr.org\/key-changes.html\">GDPR<\/a>), that came into action on May 24th. This regulation comes to prove, that the law payed attention to the <strong>evolution of marketing practices<\/strong>, and is therefore impacting businesses in regards to <strong>customer data protection<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, the <strong>conditions for consent have been strenghtened<\/strong>, meaning consent must be &#8220;&#8230;clear, distinguishable and provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language&#8230;&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h2>Comfortable customers and data collection through surveys<\/h2>\n<p>Using\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfeelback.com\/en\/features\">surveys<\/a>\u00a0is a safe choice for big data collection amongst current customers.<\/p>\n<p>Surveys ask customers to <strong>provide declarative data instead of recording tracked data<\/strong>, meaning the customer never shares something he doesn&#8217;t want to share.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The fact that the information provided in a survey is provided by the customer himself can be a relief to advertisers who are concerned with <strong>breaching ethical standards <\/strong>in their data collection practices.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A customer responding in their own words to marketing related questions, will help marketers to<strong> avoid drawing false conclusions<\/strong> simply based on numbers.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you use <strong>website tracking<\/strong> to measure a potential customer&#8217;s interest in your product, you <strong>may confuse<\/strong> a student doing a research project on your industry, with a very interested potential customer. Both would visit your website often in a short period of time, but for <strong>very different reasons<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Surveys allow you to get<strong> straightforward, qualitative data <\/strong>about your customers as well as help you<strong>\u00a0avoid privacy issues.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-knowledge-surveys.png\" alt=\"customer-knowledge-survey\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Whether with surveys or with other means of customer-based data collection, it can be <strong>surprising how willing customers are<\/strong> to share their information with you when they feel <strong>empowered<\/strong> to do so.<\/p>\n<p>Because surveys allow you to <strong>craft questions<\/strong> based on a specific type of customer, you can often yield impressive results by asking compelling and relevant questions that<strong> spark a customer&#8217;s interest<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The &#8220;tracking&#8221;\u00a0 method may be preferable to businesses strictly relying on &#8220;click&#8221;, without any interest in using a personal approach.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Whenever you fall on the big data\/privacy debate, it&#8217;s important to always<strong> respect your customers<\/strong> and give them the opportunity to <strong>speak up for themselves<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Maintaining <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nedarc.org\/tutorials\/collectingData\/howToCollectData\/ethicalConfidentialityIssues.html\">confidentiality<\/a> about the data you collect and being vigilant to avoid mistakes is essential to establish a good customer relationship.<\/p>\n<p>There will always be those who decide not to take the high road, whether by selling data without consent or ignoring &#8220;do not track&#8221; options when customers select them.
