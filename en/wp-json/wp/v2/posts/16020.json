When a company performs CRM enrichment through surveys, they are investing their <strong>time and energy into collecting <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/customer-knowledge-get-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customer knowledge<\/a><\/strong>.

Marketing should be just as much about customer retention as it is about reaching new audiences.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because your current customers are a marketers most valuable asset, and considering that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/vala-afshar\/50-important-customer-exp_b_8295772.html\">67% of consumers site bad experiences as reason for churn<\/a>, <strong>keeping them happy should arguably be a marketers main goal<\/strong>.
