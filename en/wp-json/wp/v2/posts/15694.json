This second objective is probably even more strategic than the first. Here are our 3 tips to keep your customers interested in your brand.<\/p>\n<h2>Keep in Touch with Customers<\/h2>\n<p>All companies work towards acquiring new customers because more customers = more revenue. Which is why lead nurturing (B2B), and marketing and advertising campaigns (B2C) are such central parts of any business.<br \/>\nBut more and more companies are aware that simply acquiring customers isn\u2019t enough. In fact, it could even be said that the real work only begins after the customer has been acquired.<br \/>\nBy the \u201creal work\u201d, we mean what is known as the \u201ccustomer relationship\u201d. The customer relationship includes all the actions and interactions that help you stay in touch with the customer after their purchase. The aim is to maintain and develop their interest in your brand. Afterall, a customer who only buys once is of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/larrymyler\/2016\/06\/08\/acquiring-new-customers-is-important-but-retaining-them-accelerates-profitable-growth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">little value to your company<\/a>.<br \/>\nIn other words, the quality of your customer relationship depends on your ability to build customer loyalty and increase your revenue per customer. Here are 3 tips to improve your customer relationship and keep in touch with your customers on a long-term basis.<\/p>\n<h2>1 \u2014 Communicate About Updates and New Products \/ Services<\/h2>\n<p>Effective and targeted communication all year round is key to keeping your customers on their toes and encouraging them to make new purchases.<br \/>\nRegularly inform your customers of any company news and highlight your new products, services, special deals, events, etc.You can also communicate on subjects relating to your activity or business. This can be a real added value. For example, inform customers of any new insurance legislation if you\u2019re an insurance company, or new clothing trends if you\u2019re in the retail business. This form of communication helps strengthen your status as an expert in your field.<br \/>\nYou can use several communication channels to keep your customers up to date. The first one that comes to mind is email or newsletters. But don\u2019t forget about social media (first Facebook and then Twitter), or even letters, text messages and telephone (more costly).<br \/>\nMake sure to adapt your communication channels to your target. While the telephone is often an effective channel in a B2B context, it tends to be more difficult to use for B2C companies.<br \/>\nEffective communication should also be \u201ctargeted\u201d. This means sending different content to customers depending on their profile. We\u2019ll come back to this for our 3rd tip.<\/p>\n<h2>2 \u2014 Ask Customers for Feedback About Your Products and Services<\/h2>\n<p>Asking for feedback is the most effective method to build a strong and lasting relationship with your customers and to develop an attachment to your company. Unlike traditional corporate communication, which is often one-sided, asking for feedback creates interactivity and boosts the customer relationship.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asking for feedback also makes your customers feel valued. Customers like knowing that their opinion counts and that their satisfaction is at the heart of your company\u2019s concerns. Not to mention that feedback also gives you a better understanding of their requirements, expectations and needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefits of asking for customer feedback are threefold. It:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Makes the customer relationship more dynamic, lively and therefore efficient.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improves your company\u2019s brand image (customer appreciation).\u00a0On this topic, find out how to improve your company\u2019s brand image.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helps to strengthen your customer knowledge and understand their expectations.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We recommend regularly asking your customers if they\u2019re satisfied with your products and services. Make sure that they know how important their opinion is and how much their satisfaction matters to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/cx-management-en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Customer surveys<\/a> are also the best tools to ask your customers for feedback. You can deploy surveys by email (e.g., after the purchase of a product), on social media or directly on your website (e.g., in the form of a pop-up).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3 \u2014 Segment your Customer Base to Personalise your Customer Relationship<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are, to put it simply, two customer profiles: those who buy (more or less) regularly and those who no longer buy and gather dust in your customer database. It\u2019s important to address these two profiles differently.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reactivation campaigns for inactive customers aim to remind them that you still exist and pique their interest with relevant and attractive content (new products, special offers, invitations, etc.).<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers also all have different needs and don\u2019t necessarily share the same interests. You should therefore segment your customer database based on what you know about your customers and their purchasing history. Segmentation will enable you to personalise your communication and marketing campaigns.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acquiring a customer is just the first step. Only then does your work around the customer relationship begin. Here are three tips to keep in touch with your customers after their first purchase:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact them regularly so that they don\u2019t forget you and their interest in your brand increases (using the right communication channels).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Involve them in your company by asking for their feedback via surveys deployed on various channels.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Segment your customer base to send them personalised messages (content + offers).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>3 Simple Tips to Keep your Customers Interested August 6, 2021 3 Simple Tips to Keep your Customers Interested August 6, 2021 Companies should always be working towards two complementary but distinct objectives: seeking to acquire new customers (1) and building a relationship with existing customers to develop their interest and loyalty (2).
