Customer data can help, enabling a business to demonstrate authentic concern for the customer, resulting in stronger customer relationships, better retention, and more referrals. Here\u2019s why.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\">1- Don\u2019t assume price is most important<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cost is certainly a consideration for consumers but various studies indicate that it is not the most decisive factor. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.retailcustomerexperience.com\/articles\/survey-twice-as-many-people-tell-others-about-bad-service-than-good\/\">American Express<\/a>, for example, finds that 7 in 10 Americans are willing to spend more with companies they believe provide excellent customer service. And Defaqto Research reports that <strong>more than half (55%) of consumers will pay more to ensure a superior customer experience<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, consumers are seeking the best value from businesses, value which includes not just price but \u2013 importantly \u2013 a high level of service.&nbsp; Listening to your customers will enable you to gather valuable insights into how your customers are interacting with\u2014and feeling about\u2014your product and support. Working with this <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/challenge-your-products\/\">feedback<\/a>, you can make sure you are delivering a customer experience that is worth your their time and money. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">2- Be more helpful<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/smallbiztrends.com\/2016\/07\/customer-complaints-customer-service.html\">SmallBusinessTrends<\/a> reports findings from a recent study which indicates that <strong>the number one reason why more than one-third (34%) of consumers voice a complaint is poor customer service<\/strong>, with rudeness, bad attitude, lack of knowledge, and delays the most common, specific reasons for these complaints. And the impact these grievances have on a retailer cannot be overstated: <a href=\"http:\/\/marketingland.com\/survey-customers-more-frustrated-by-how-long-it-takes-to-resolve-a-customer-service-issue-than-the-resolution-38756\"><strong>90% of consumers<\/strong><\/a><strong> admit they are influenced by online reviews.<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With customer experience an increasingly important differentiator (and, according to many, the single most important differentiator), retailers must make a long-term commitment to delivering the support customers want and need. This requires regularly gathering customer knowledge, measuring the support you offer from your customers\u2019 point of view.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\">3- Provide a seamless multichannel experience<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PWC finds <strong>86% of US consumers usually shop across at least two channels<\/strong>. Moreover, <strong>88% of US shoppers research a product online before buying and 73% research online specifically when buying clothing, footwear, toys, and health and beauty products<\/strong>. And this online research doesn\u2018t just lead to online purchases; often times, it is a critical step in a larger journey, leading to purchases via other channels.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, retailers must be adaptive and agile with today\u2019s technology, embracing customer demand for a multichannel shopping experience. Customers are increasingly shopping across a variety of channels \u2013 brick and mortar, website, mobile app \u2013 even using a variety of channels to complete just a single purchase.&nbsp; To provide a seamless experience, you must clearly understand customers\u2019 preferred channels and have the ability to synchronize multiple databases (customer, sales, inventory, financial) in order to provide a friction-free experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\">4- Personalize, personalize, personalize<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Personalization is everything in today\u2019s retail environment. For example, nearly <strong>three-fourths (<\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.business2community.com\/online-marketing\/personalized-ecommerce-impact-online-sales-conversion-01162073\"><strong>74%<\/strong><\/a><strong>) of online consumers express frustration with irrelevant communication<\/strong> (offers, ads, promotions). Therefore, it should come as no surprise that personalized email communication delivers <a href=\"http:\/\/marketingland.com\/study-70-brands-personalizing-emails-missing-higher-transaction-rates-revenue-73241\">six times higher transaction rates<\/a> than do email blasts or that MyBuys reports <strong>40% of consumers buy more from <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/5-key-opportunities-for-online-retailers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">retailers <\/a>who can personalize communication across all channels<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To successfully personalize the customer experience, retailers must understand the importance of customer segmentation. Customer segmentation refers to the process of using customer data to create a clustering of customers with shared attributes. Communication can then be customized to say different things in different ways according to the specific wants and needs of each customer group. This will enable you to deliver greater value to your customers who are more likely to feel their needs and interests are being specifically addressed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, customers are looking for value to be clearly demonstrated, value which reflects the right balance of price, product, and service tailored to fit their needs. <strong>They prefer to buy products from companies who understand them and are able to clearly demonstrate that understanding<\/strong>. &nbsp;And to earn customer loyalty, businesses must constantly meet their expectations \u2013 delivering the right products at the right time via the right channels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\" id=\"hs-cta-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/20304540\/cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" height=\"159\" width=\"700\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a.png\" alt=\"Discover our Solutions: Book your Demo\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(20304540, 'cb2d0916-f405-47e9-bb18-4064b993938a', {\"useNewLoader\":\"true\",\"region\":\"na1\"}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To remain competitive, today&#8217;s retailers need to embrace both a data-centric business strategy and a consumer centric mindset.&nbsp; Data allows retailers to identify, track and understand their customers at a deeper, more personal level, increasing their relevance, customer engagement and, of course, revenue.\u00a0 An interactive, ever-evolving knowledge database about individual customers before, during, and after&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":23538,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"post_folder":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>4 Tips for Retailers Who Hate to Lose Customers - Skeepers<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Customer data is key to delivering the right balance of price, product and personalized service that retailers will pay more for.
