We place great value on integrating our Feedback Management Solution with the CRM and BI tools that our clients use.<\/p>\n<p>Our Adobe Campaign connector works with both versions of the solution:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.campaign.adobe.com\/doc\/AC\/en\/PTF_Starting_with_Adobe_Campaign_About_Adobe_Campaign_Classic.html\">Adobe Campaign Classic<\/a> (v6.11 and v7)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/helpx.adobe.com\/support\/campaign\/standard.html\">Adobe Campaign Standard<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By using our connector, you can upload feedback that you have collected from your customers via surveys, in real time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 302px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/integrate-adobe-campaign.png\" alt=\"integrate-adobe-campaign\" \/><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><em>Skeepers <\/em><em>is the only EFM platform that offers seamless integration with the 2 versions of Adobe Campaign, with no technical intervention required. <\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Using this connector:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/send-surveys-by-email-adobe-campaign-standard\/\">send invitations to surveys created<\/a> using\u00a0<strong>Skeepers<\/strong> directly via the Adobe Campaign interface. We recommend that you continue using the campaign editor available in Adobe Campaign rather than the one in Skeepers, simply because this prevents your data from being disbursed among various different tools.<\/li>\n<li>Your <strong>contact pages<\/strong> will continuously be updated with the information that you receive from your surveys (profile information, preferences, satisfaction scores, etc.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 295px; height: 345px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/adobe-campaign-missing-customer-data.png\" alt=\"adobe-campaign-missing-customer-data\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The information that you obtain from Skeepers enables you to create more consistent audience segments and a more targeted marketing approach.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Remember, Skeepers is a <strong>customer knowledge solution<\/strong> that enables you to create and share highly-targeted surveys via all different channels: websites, email, text messages, social networks, chatbots, and mobile apps, as well as terminals in stores.<\/p>\n<p>Our solution also includes an advanced reporting tool and dashboard to help you analyze the feedback that you have collected and track changes to your indicators.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>To learn more, see our article on <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/enrich-personas-adobe-campaign\/\"><strong>How you can enrich your personas in Adobe Campaign<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>What features can Skeepers offer, compared to the Adobe Campaign Classic survey module?<\/h2>\n<p>Adobe Campaign Standard does not include any customer survey features, while Adobe Campaign Classic offers a survey module. Nonetheless, there are still benefits to integrating Skeepers with Adobe Campaign Classic, as the Skeepers solution enables you to go further in terms of creating and sharing your customer knowledge or customer satisfaction surveys.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the key benefits of using Skeepers in place of the Adobe Campaign Classic survey module:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Skeepers allows for <strong>omnichannel sharing of your surveys<\/strong>, including via text message, <a href=\"http:\/\/get.myfeelback.com\/en\/chat-surveys\">ChatSurvey<\/a>, pop-in ads or social networks. This can not be done using the \u00a0module in Adobe Campaign Classic.<\/li>\n<li>Skeepers is a <strong>cloud-based solution <\/strong>that can be accessed from anywhere, at any time, and from any device (computer, tablet or smartphone), while the Adobe Campaign Classic software needs to be installed on a hard drive.<\/li>\n<li>With Skeepers, your recipients can answer the first question of the survey directly in the body of the email, enabling you to achieve <strong>significantly higher response rates. <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 368px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/email-invitation-survey-adobe-campaign-nps-integrated_0.png\" alt=\"email-invitation-survey-adobe-campaign-nps-integrated\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Skeepers enables you to <strong>program post-survey actions. <\/strong>This is a key point, as collecting customer feedback and comments is only valuable if these are used to trigger specific actions.
