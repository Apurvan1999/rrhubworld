They let your customers know that their <strong>opinions matter<\/strong>, that in fact, their opinions are at the heart of your business\u2019s success. Customer insight is so important that, by the end of this year, an estimated <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.gartner.com\/jake-sorofman\/gartner-surveys-confirm-customer-experience-new-battlefield\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>89% of businesses<\/strong><\/a> will have competed on <strong>customer experience, <\/strong>with customer feedback being<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>a crucial component of providing that experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Industry leaders recognize the value of customer insights but, likewise, understand that gathering this insight can prove to be a<strong> challenge<\/strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/ways-feedback-surveys-are-frustrating-customers.jpg\" alt=\"feedback surveys for people\" class=\"wp-image-23809\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Carefully designing<\/strong> and administering your feedback survey is necessary to ensure high response rates, providing you with enough feedback that you can make sound customer service<strong> improvements<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since there is no specific magic formula that will work for every business, the following are three <strong>practical, general approaches<\/strong> which will <strong>work for anyone.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\">1. Define clear goals for your feedback surveys&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your first step must be to determine what you need to know and make this a clear goal to your customers. Feedback survey goals typically include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Gathering <\/strong>feedback on new product and service ideas.&nbsp;<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/customer-satisfaction-score-csat-how-to-use\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Measuring customer satisfaction<\/strong> <\/a>and finding areas that need improvement.<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Identifying <\/strong>key traits of your most profitable customers and <strong>what influences them<\/strong> during the sales cycle.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The most effective survey will have a <strong>clearly defined <\/strong>objective and <strong>well-written questions<\/strong> related to that goal.&nbsp; But if your goals aren\u2019t clear, your survey results won\u2019t be either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To yield better responses, only ask your customers about what is really important. Remember you <strong>don&#8217;t want<\/strong> a&nbsp;database full of <strong>useless information<\/strong>.<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong> &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/feedback-surveys-are-frustrating-customers.jpg\" alt=\"goals feedback surveys\" class=\"wp-image-23805\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers will complete your survey but only if they see it is <strong>relevant <\/strong>and will&nbsp;improve their experience. In fact, a study showed that <strong>83% of consumers<\/strong> have already completed at least one or, in many cases, three to four feedback surveys in the past 12 months, with 70% admitting they <strong>want to help companies improve <\/strong>their products.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\">2. Ask the right questions!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your survey needs to be designed so that it encourages maximum<strong> response rates<\/strong>. Therefore, consider what you see as <strong>ideal feedback<\/strong> and draft questions which invite the most responses. In general:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You should <strong>know exactly<\/strong> what information each question can be expected to yield. If you don\u2019t, reconsider <strong>or drop the question.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Never ask a question<\/strong> just because you think the information it yields might come in handy one day, you\u2019re just wasting everyones time.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Likewise, if you already have certain customer data (name, age, or gender), don\u2019t ask for it again. You\u2019ll only end up <strong>frustrating your customers<\/strong> and generating useless, duplicate&nbsp;data.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/ways-feedback-surveys-are.jpg\" alt=\"ways\" class=\"wp-image-23807\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Just avoid annoying your customers with unnecessary questions. The more time-consuming your survey the less effective it will be &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/lydiadishman\/2014\/03\/07\/retailers-your-surveys-are-making-customers-suffer\/#7d67b6a8581a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>80% of customers<\/strong><\/a> <strong>abandon <\/strong>a survey halfway through and 52% of customers claim that they would not spend more than 3 minutes completing a feedback survey.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\">3. Minimize customer fustration to maximize completion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to carefully consider what might prevent your customers from providing insights since higher rates of survey abandonment equal less useful, accurate feedback. Some <strong>common points of frictions<\/strong> which could minimize completion include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Customers find the survey <strong>confusing or time-consuming<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/li><li>They don\u2019t feel a strong enough connection with the company so <strong>see no point in providing<\/strong> their feedback.&nbsp;<\/li><li>You are targeting the<strong> wrong customer<\/strong> demographic.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider how many completed surveys you will need in order to obtain<strong> reliable and accurate results<\/strong> and what a likely overall response rate should be. And keep in mind that achieving a <strong>100%<\/strong> completion rate is not necessarily a valid goal in and of itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more valid goal is to collect feedback from a <strong>representative sample<\/strong> of your customers, making sure that everyone who would like to respond has an equal opportunity to do so, that there is <strong>nothing preventing<\/strong> them from sharing their insights.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\">More tips to increase your response rate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Making sure you tackle the three aspects above, will for sure help you improve your response rate. But there are a few more things that are also good to keep in mind when you go about <strong>building your survey<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Make it easy<b>: <\/b>Try to reduce the amount of self-writting answers, by providing<strong> different answering possibilities<\/strong> likely to match your customer&#8217;s thoughts.<\/li><li><strong>Sensitive topics<\/strong>: place them at the end of your survey, by then the connection with the customer has already been made, so the<strong> initial mistrust is over <\/strong>and they&#8217;ll be more willing to provide information.<\/li><li>Hide and seek: you can also ease a questionin, by putting it as a <strong>sub-question<\/strong> to another one that they are <strong>more willing to answer.<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Let them understand: <\/strong>you know why you&#8217;re doing your survey, but let your customers also know how this will help them.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By taking into account these kind of details, you will definitely increase the power of your surveys and get the feedback you&#8217;re are looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People expect brands to understand them as people, that communications should be<strong> tailored to their values and preferences<\/strong>, it behooves you to make sure you are creating relevant feedback opportunities, that are easy-to-use, that improve the customer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the <strong>right planning<\/strong>, you can avoid mistakes which prevent survey completion, providing you with the insights you need to create an experience that keeps them <strong>coming back for more<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" id=\"hs-cta-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/20304540\/50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" height=\"223\" width=\"700\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1.png\" alt=\"15 questions to know your customers needs and expectations\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(20304540, '50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1', {\"useNewLoader\":\"true\",\"region\":\"na1\"}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Feedback surveys are the most effective way to obtain information about your customers, identify opportunities, and improve your overall relationships.
