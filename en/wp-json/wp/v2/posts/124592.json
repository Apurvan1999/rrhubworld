The brand believes skincare should be fun\u2014including sensorial textures, colorful packaging, and innovative ingredients. Their watermelon masks and moisturizers are already cult-favorites in the beauty industry and all of their products are clean, vegan and cruelty-free, and free of parabens, sulfates, and phthalates, among others.<\/p><h3>Challenge<\/h3>\n<p>Glow Recipe first approached Octoly for impactful user reviews around the launch of a new product, Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Dew Drops. Following the first collaboration, Mallory Goldberg, Senior Director Of Marketing at Glow Recipe, says the brand decided to extend their goals with Octoly from review seeding with their key product launches to their core product catalogue. \u201cWe wanted to make sure we are continuing to update some of our hero SKUs with new and relevant reviews,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Goldberg says Glow Recipe recognized how critical reviews are to the overall marketing process in the industry, so finding a way to do targeted review seeding at scale was important to the brand. \u201cWe wanted to make sure we\u2019re getting real reviews,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want people to give their unbiased opinions, and being able to seed products to align with for a specific launch date was also critical.\u201d<\/p><h3>Results<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been impressed at Octoly\u2019s response rate of reviews,\u201d says Goldberg. \u201cLet\u2019s say we seed products for a new launch to the Octoly community; we\u2019ve been averaging over 97% of those people going online and writing the review.\u201d This, she says, has helped Glow Recipe maximize the product and ensure they\u2019re always being smart with resources.<\/p>\n<p>The reviews themselves also, she says, have been \u201cincredibly strong.\u201d \u201cOctoly has enabled us to launch a product at the start with such strong reviews which has helped us with overall marketing.\u201d The best example, Goldberg says, was their new product launch this spring. Glow Recipe partnered with Octoly for their new Avocado Serum in April and, so far, the product has 918 reviews and 4.8 stars. <\/p><h3>The Solution<\/h3>\n<p>Since the first collaboration, Glow Recipe launched \u201calmost all\u201d of their new products using Octoly\u2019s review seeding, targeting each to align with their product launch dates. \u201cReviews are critical to us in the beauty space and Octoly has connected us with influential beauty enthusiasts who can try the product multiple times and speak to their takeaway from the product, as well as how it works for their skin type and concern,\u201d Goldberg says.<\/p>\n<p>Goldberg says Octoly review seeding produced highly engaged reviews for each of the launches at a large scale which encouraged more people to try the product and share exactly why it worked for them. Glow Recipe plans on partnering with Octoly on some smaller-scale UGC (User Generated Content) campaigns moving forward to utilize the Octoly influencer network. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to test out the new Octoly UGC platform for TikTok, while prioritizing Octoly as a core review partner,\u201d she said.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">The results in 1 year<\/p><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Reviews<\/h4><p style=\"text-align: center;\">3,633<\/p><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Product Rating<\/h4><p style=\"text-align: center;\">4.7\/5<\/p><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Would Recommend<\/h4><p style=\"text-align: center;\">98%<\/p><p><b>\u201cOctoly is an extremely efficient way to get reviews from the engaged beauty community at scale and with efficiency.
