MyFeelBack\u2019s connector enables you to automatically upload your customers\u2019 NPS scores directly to your Adobe Campaign Standard account.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we\u2019ll explain how to do this, as well as the benefits of this approach.<\/p>\n<h2>How the Net Promoter Score can help you customize your marketing communications<\/h2>\n<p>The Net Promoter Score is one of the most well-known and widely used customer satisfaction indicators. If you are not yet familiar with the Net Promoter Score, we recommend consulting our <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/complete-guide-net-promoter-score-nps\/\">complete guide to the NPS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 346px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/example-nps-question.jpg\" alt=\"example-nps-question\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>The NPS: an indicator of customer satisfaction and of recommendation<\/h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s a brief overview of the NPS: this indicator shows the probability of your customers recommending your brand (or service, product, etc.) to those around them, to their friends or family, or to their colleagues (depending on the context.) Customers give a score between 0 and 10, and fall into one of three categories based on the score they give: <strong>Detractors<\/strong>, <strong>Passives<\/strong>, or <strong>Promoters<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>To obtain an overall score, use the following formula:<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 244px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/nps-score-calculation-1.png\" alt=\"nps-score-calculation\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>The NPS as a market segmentation tool<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to being a customer satisfaction indicator, the NPS is also a <strong>marketing segmentation tool. <\/strong>This brings us to Adobe Campaign Standard: Adobe Campaign enables you to manage multichannel marketing campaigns and send highly targeted messages and offers to your <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/criteria-customer-segmentation-database\/\">customer segments<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>These segments can be created using various different attributes, which may be sociodemographic (age, name,socio-professional category), psychographic (interests, preferences, opinions) or behavioral (websites visited, links clicked in an email). Each segment groups together contacts that have similar attributes. Adobe Campaign Standard enables you to create these customer segments and use them to create targeted marketing campaigns or Marketing Automation scenarios.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 328px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/adobe-campaign-customer-profile-nps.png\" alt=\"adobe-campaign-customer-profile-nps\" \/><br \/>\n<em>Example of a customer profile in<\/em><em> ACS<\/em><em> that includes the NPS attribute collected via <\/em><em>MyFeelBack<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The NPS can be used in Adobe Campaign as a customer segmentation attribute, and can also help you create targeted marketing campaigns, just like any other type of attribute.<\/p>\n<h2>How to use the NPS in Adobe Campaign<\/h2>\n<h3>Using the NPS score to enhance your marketing campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>With the MyFeelBack connector, you can <strong>automatically upload your customers\u2019 NPS scores, in real time, to your contact pages in Adobe Campaign. <\/strong>This requires setting up a mapping configuration, which is explained in detail in our <a href=\"http:\/\/help.myfeelback.com\/parametres-settings\/how-to-use-myfeelback-to-feed-adobe-campaign-adobe-campaign-standard-crm\">help center<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 368px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/adobe-campaign-mapping.jpg\" alt=\"adobe-campaign-mapping\" \/><br \/>\n<em>Example of the integration of NPS feedback in the NPS section of <\/em><em>ACS<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This method enables you to\u00a0<strong>segment your contacts based on their answers to NPS questions<\/strong>. For example, you could create three different attributes in the NPS profile segment: Detractors, Passives and Promoters. You can then deploy different messages, campaigns or scenarios based on each of these attributes. Using this approach, the NPS<strong> enables you to customize your marketing actions <\/strong>managed using Adobe Campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Our Adobe Campaign connector also lets you deploy marketing emails or receive alerts, in real time, as soon as you receive an NPS score.<\/p>\n<p>To help you use the NPS as effectively as possible, here are a few questions that you can include in your MyFeelBack surveys, as well as some examples of actions that you can deploy via Adobe Campaign.<\/p>\n<h3>What type of campaign should you use with Detractors?<\/h3>\n<p>For\u00a0<strong>detractors\u00a0<\/strong>(participants who have given a score between 0 and 6) you\u2019ll first need to understand their reasons for giving a low score. Via MyFeelBack, you can create a scenario that asks these participants the following questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cWhat did you like the least about [Name of product or service]?\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cIn your opinion, what could we do to improve our product or service?\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To address any problems the customer may have experienced, you can also give them the option to receive a call from your customer service team.<\/p>\n<p>You can then schedule an email to be sent to the customer via Adobe Campaign, assuring them that the problem is being addressed and that you are working to find the best possible solution. Here\u2019s an example of a customized campaign aimed at detractors who found prices to be too high:<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 368px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/email-detractor-nps-adobe-campaign.png\" alt=\"email-detractor-nps-adobe-campaign\" \/><br \/>\n<em>Example of an email sent via ACS to detractors who were unsatisfied with the company\u2019s pricing<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This NPS campaign addresses two goals for this customer segment:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>identify <strong>areas for improvement<\/strong>\u00a0in order to optimize service quality, the customer experience, and overall customer satisfaction levels, and<\/li>\n<li>resolve any <strong>specific problems encountered by participants <\/strong>to avoid losing them as customers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>After a customer\u2019s problem has been resolved, it can be beneficial to ask them the NPS question again at a later date. This new survey can be sent via Adobe Campaign 15 days after the problem has been resolved.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>For more information about this topic, see our article <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/optimize-value-negative-customer-feedback\/\">How to Optimize the Value of Negative Feedback<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>What type of campaign should you use with Promoters?<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<p>Here are a few questions that you could send to your <strong>promoters<\/strong> after they have answered the NPS question:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What did you appreciate the most?<\/li>\n<li>What led you to give this score?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also encourage them to <strong>promote your brand or product by rating it\u00a0<\/strong>(on the app store, a marketplace, or GoogleMyBusiness).<\/p>\n<p>These questions enable you to <strong>determine your brand\u2019s strong points<\/strong>, which you can then use to strengthen your brand image.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a Brand Ambassadors program, <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/reasons-build-customer-loyalty\/\">a customer loyalty program<\/a> or a referral program, you could invite your promoters to join.
