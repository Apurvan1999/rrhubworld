There appears to be a KPI metric for every situation, so we do our best to collect and make sense out of them all.<\/p>\n<p>Data is great and necessary for your business, but it&#8217;s also important to spend time collecting <strong>the right data<\/strong>. This will prevent you from<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>wasting precious time and energy with useless information that&#8217;s just going to sit there without doing anything to help your business.<\/p>\n<p>To collect this data from your customers, you can use surveys, which can become your best friend or on the contrary make your customers annoyed <strong>if not used wisely<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>You get it,\u00a0 surveying customers has a lot to do with timing. Surveys are a marketing <strong>data goldmine<\/strong> for so many reasons: they allow you to increase customer satisfaction, reduce churn, get <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/best-worst-times-survey-customers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new ideas<\/a> for new content and services, as well as quantify and qualify your marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, it&#8217;s essential to make sure you are surveying your customers when it <strong>matters the most<\/strong>, so that the data you collect is <strong>helpful and relevant<\/strong>. Here are a few tips about when to survey your customers and what you should avoid doing.<\/p>\n<h2>1 &#8211; Survey your visitors directly after an interaction with your company<\/h2>\n<p>One of the smartest things you can do as a marketer is survey your customers straight\u00a0<strong>after their experience <\/strong>with your company.<\/p>\n<p>Ask for feedback while it&#8217;s <strong>still hot<\/strong>, after a service was delivered, a customer called customer support to get help or for example when a customer has abandoned their cart.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because one of the most important aspects of customer feedback is <strong>avoiding churn<\/strong><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 945px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG-cart-abandonment-mobile-survey.png\" alt=\"leaving website survey\" \/><br \/>\n<em style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\">MyFeelBack Cart abandonment survey question example<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If your customers have an <strong>unpleasant experience<\/strong> with your company, they may very well decide to contribute to the 91% of unhappy customers who leave a company because they are dissatisfied, but without actually complaining about it. Surveying customers right after an interaction is giving them an outlet to express their<strong> dissatisfaction <\/strong>so that you can fix it.<\/p>\n<p>Considering and fixing a bad experience is an effective way of\u00a0<strong>making people stick around<\/strong>. An estimated 67% of this customer churn is preventable if a customer issue is resolved at the time it occurs, but you have to be alerted of the problem in order to fix it, and a survey is a great way to ensure that.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Tip: A great way to do this is by <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/ultimate-guide-creating-customer-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">offering a feedback survey right on your website.<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately this is where some businesses that use surveys <strong>go wrong<\/strong>, they are not using them at the right time, often <strong>waiting too long<\/strong> after an interaction. You shouldn &#8216;t wait a few days to get follow up on the customer&#8217;s experience: it may be too late already. On the other hand, you <strong>shoudn&#8217;t bombard them<\/strong> with surveys either, being timely is the key to success.<\/p>\n<h2>2 &#8211; A good time to survey your customers is just before\u00a0making a big change<\/h2>\n<p>We&#8217;re always looking for <strong>innovative<\/strong> ways to change up our company, in order to make it the best it can be. However, <strong>not all change is welcomed<\/strong> by loyal customers who are comfortable with your product the way it is.<\/p>\n<p>Sending out a survey before a big change does several things to help you<strong>.<\/strong> First of all, it <strong>alerts <\/strong>your customer that a change is coming and gives them a perceived <strong>feeling of power <\/strong>over the change.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 607px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/change-survey-question.png\" alt=\"change survey question\" \/><br \/>\n<em style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\">MyFeelBack survey change question<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, being asked about their <strong>opinion<\/strong> on the change will make them feel engaged, included and therefore more<strong> likely to accept the change<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Second of all, it provides you with useful information on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.surveypolice.com\/blog\/how-5-massive-companies-changed-using-market-research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>how the change will benefit your customers<\/strong><\/a>, as well as giving them a chance to speak up if it represents a problem for them.
