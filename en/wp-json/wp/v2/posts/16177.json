A BCG study highlights the strengths and<br \/>weaknesses of France with regard to digital transformation &#8230;<\/p>\n<p>During the 5th edition of the University of digital technology, the MEDEF, as part of its<br \/>commission &#8220;Technological changes and societal impacts&#8221; chaired by Christian Nibourel, and<br \/>the BCG revealed a comprehensive and unprecedented analysis of the digital maturity of<br \/>France in todays global competitive economy.<br \/>This international study shows that France holds strong positions on several essential<br \/>dimensions of digital transformation, but it also reveals real weaknesses &#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>The strengths of digital France<\/strong><br \/>This study lists 4 areas in which France ranks among the best in the world:<br \/><strong># 1 &#8211; Training<\/strong><br \/>The quality of training of digital talents,with a view in particular to France\u2019s excellent scientific<br \/>training courses: France is between 6th and 7th place in the main world rankings;<br \/><strong># 2 &#8211; Research<\/strong><br \/>Incentives for research: 20% of businesses R &amp; D is indirectly supported by the government<br \/>through incentives, which places France in 3rd position worldwide;<\/p>\n<p><strong># 3 &#8211; Access to data<\/strong><br \/>The availability of public data: according to the OECD, France ranks second in terms of access<br \/>to data and third in terms of data availability;<br \/><strong># 4 &#8211; Security<\/strong><br \/>State commitment to cybersecurity: France ranks 8th for the Global Cybersecurity Index,<br \/>calculated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).<br \/>Weak points to watch out for<br \/>France must overcome major weaknesses to stay ahead of the pack before joining the leading<br \/>group.<br \/>Today, a third of SMEs in France say that digital transformation is not on their agenda this year.<br \/>For example, less than one in five companies have adopted Artificial Intelligence (AI) in their<br \/>strategy.<\/p>\n<p>The study shows that there are three main challenges to be met by all political and economic<br \/>actors to mobilize and win for the entire French ecosystem:<\/p>\n<p><strong># 1 &#8211; Succeed in keeping your most skilled workers<\/strong><br \/>Although the quality of French training is recognized, the study points to a real quantitative<br \/>weakness in terms of digital talent, both for initial training and for continuing training.<br \/>The French deficit is estimated at 200,000 people by 2022.<br \/>This phenomenon is aggravated by growing desires for expatriation: 76% of French digital<br \/>talents would be ready to work abroad, which is nine points higher than the world average.<br \/>To retain staff, first actions have been taken (easing of the labor market, &#8220;French Tech&#8221; visa,<br \/>investment plan in skills, draft law Pact), but the battle of brains and skills is just beginning,<br \/>regardless of the level of qualification, in a very global digital business market.<\/p>\n<p><strong># 2 &#8211; Facilitate investment<\/strong><br \/>The digitalization of businesses requires access to very highspeed broadband, an essential<br \/>issue of regional planning.<br \/>While in France, the plan &#8220;France Very Broadband&#8221; is still incomplete, we must continue the<br \/>deployment of fiber and quickly engage 5G.<br \/>However, public policies tend to slow investments (competition, productive taxes, license fees).<\/p>\n<p><strong># 3 &#8211; A shy data strategy<\/strong><br \/>On the business side, the report points to a delay in the collection and exploitation of data, due<br \/>in particular to a too restrictive application of the legal framework (RGPD in particular).<br \/>These constraints weigh in the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications for companies.<br \/>The pioneers, who invested early in AI, now have room for maneuver allowing them to<br \/>accelerate further and widen the gap: 88% of them have increased their investment AI<br \/>compared to last year, against less than two-thirds of the other companies.<br \/>In this race against the clock, the United States and China have already spewed: the 20 largest<br \/>digital companies are either American or Chinese.<\/p>\n<p>As another example, the United States has 151 unicorns, China 82 and Europe only 34.<br \/>Possible pathways for the future<br \/>Beyond the purely economic stakes, staying in the leading group is an issue of digital<br \/>sovereignty for France.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The authors distinguish three priorities:<br \/><\/strong><br \/>Increase by + 60% the talent pool available by 2022;<br \/>Evolve the regulations in the telecommunications sector to put in place a competitive policy at<br \/>national and European level favoring the investment capacity of operators<br \/>Help companies to adopt a data strategy to collect and use data in line with the legal framework,<br \/>without over-interpretation.<\/p>\n<p>Article taken from co-marketing news<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Training, infrastructures, politics, data, innovations &#8230;
