Today\u2019s consumers are smarter, less loyal, and won\u2019t think about leaving you for a business which can deliver a better overall customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to remain competitive, you need to get the customer experience basics right. The following seven best practices will help you deliver an experience that is efficient, consistent, and \u2013 importantly \u2013 sure to meet your customers\u2019 expectations.<\/p>\n<h2>7 Customer Experience Best Practices<\/h2>\n<h3>1) Develop a single view of the customer<\/h3>\n<p>54% of marketers cite not having a single view of customers across channels as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.atelier.net\/en\/trends\/articles\/retailling-omni-channel-approach-central-strategies-2013_423523\">the biggest obstacle to creating a successful cross-channel experience<\/a>. Unfortunately, these marketers are unable to benefit from the myriad benefits a single view provides: (1) the ability to improve each interaction with a customer, effectively enhancing the relationship with that customer; (2) more precise customer segmentation and the ability to develop targeted marketing campaigns for each segment; and (3) the ability to provide more personal, proactive customer service based on a customer\u2019s buying habits.<\/p>\n<h3>2) Gather customer data across all channels<\/h3>\n<p>Customers are interacting with online businesses on both desktop and mobile devices which can complicate the process of collecting and unifying customer information. A simple but effective way to solve this problem is by investing in a flexible CRM system. Connecting data from all channels in order to create a seamless customer experience has been shown to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.monetate.com\/blog\/the-tipping-point-for-personalized-website-experiences\/\">increase sales by up to 40%<\/a>. It stands to reason: the more connected your data, the easier it is to find out who your customers are, why they come to you, and what you need to do to meaningfully engage them.<\/p>\n<h3>3) Make every interaction timely, relevant, and personalized<\/h3>\n<p>Customers love the highly personalized experience they receive from big name companies like Amazon and <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/how-customer-satisfaction-ranks-nordstrom-at-the-top\/\">Nordstrom<\/a>, and now expect a similar experience from every company they chose to do business with. And businesses which are in a position to deliver an especially high-level experience are seeing the pay off with a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.invespcro.com\/blog\/online-shopping-personalization\/\">45% increase in customer spending<\/a>. It goes without saying that the only way to deliver this experience is via customer data. Only with data can you predict what, how often, and when customers are most likely to buy from you.<\/p>\n<h3>4) Optimize omnichannel<\/h3>\n<p>Companies need to be present on various channels. But they also need to ensure that each channel is convenient and consistent so customers receive the same experience and message everywhere. Considering that 65% of consumers complain about receiving <a href=\"http:\/\/www.synthetix.com\/website_document\/Synthetix_Online_Customer_Service_Survey_2012.pdf\">inconsistent support across channels<\/a>, incidentally one of the top reasons they decide to abandon a company, it is imperative that businesses provide the clear, seamless experience today\u2019s customer expect. Keep in mind that all touch points ultimately lead to the same destination \u2013 your overall customer experience.<\/p>\n<h3>5) Make sure your employees are happy<\/h3>\n<p>While measuring customer satisfaction is a priority, so is <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/employee-satisfaction-drives-customer-satisfaction\/\">measuring the satisfaction of your employees<\/a> who are, after all, the backbone of your internal operations. \u00a0Various studies have shown satisfied employees are more likely to interact with customers in a positive, friendly manner, meeting or even exceeding customers\u2019 expectations which, of course, helps to reduce churn. For this reason, you can\u2019t afford to overlook employee satisfaction and engagement. If you want to ensure a high-level of customer support, you must incentivize your employees to do the best job they can.<\/p>\n<h3>6) Always exceed expectations<\/h3>\n<p>9 in 10 companies are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bulldogreporter.com\/modern-branding-keeping-up-with-customers-not-competitors-is-becoming-the-greatest-challenge-to-brands\/\">struggling to deliver a customer experience<\/a> that exceeds their customers\u2019 expectations; only 7% say they actually do accomplish this goal. But with customer expectations changing all the time, and plenty of businesses vying for the attention of your customers, there is no excuse for delivering a subpar experience. A generic, one-size-fits-all model just won\u2019t cut it.\u00a0 Today\u2019s customers expect to be treated as individuals and expect you to empower them with the right information at the right time, possible only if you have at your disposal sufficient customer knowledge.<\/p>\n<h3>7) Value your customers\u2019 time by minimizing their effort<\/h3>\n<p>Ultimately, customers expect a friction-free experience. The more effort required of them to complete a transaction, the more likely they are to simply walk away. And considering how important customer retention is to your business\u2019s success, you can\u2019t afford to lose them because you aren\u2019t willing or able to provide them with an easy, effortless experience. Evaluate each interaction they have with you, using a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfelback.com\/en\/blog\/ces-easy-metric-effortless-customer-experience\">simple metric like the CES<\/a>, and make whatever improvements are necessary so you are easier to work with.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s customers will only engage with brands that understand who they are and can deliver exactly what they are looking for. Fail to understand them or their needs and they will go elsewhere. They know there is always another choice just around the corner.<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--> <a href=\"http:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d-1.png\" alt=\"Download Ebook How to Learn from your Customers and Get Ahead of your Competitors\" \/><\/a> <\/span> <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n\n        hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'e7463b74-6eee-421c-b9b7-ca593d0db47d', {});\n    \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span> <!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In today\u2019s increasingly crowded and competitive marketplace, you must differentiate in order to stand out from the crowd.
