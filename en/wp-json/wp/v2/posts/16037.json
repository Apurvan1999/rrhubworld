Meanwhile, e-commerce continues to be the fastest growing retail market in Europe, actually\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ecommercenews.eu\/ecommerce-europe-e602-billion-2017\/\">outperforming U.S. growth<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The last decade has seen nothing short of a <strong>revolution<\/strong> in customers habits. We clearly live in the age of online shopping, customers are finding it easier and more convenient to shop this way.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s any easier for an online business to be successful. The reality is that a bit more than <a href=\"https:\/\/smallbiztrends.com\/2016\/11\/startup-statistics-small-business.html\">50% startups fail<\/a>. The online marketplace has become such a<strong> competitive environment <\/strong>that only the best of<strong> the best survive.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While many factors contribute to the demise of online businesses, evidence points to a specific cause which leads many of them ashore: the <strong>lack of customer focus<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/focus.jpg\" alt=\"customer focus\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Customers quote some of their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.accenture.com\/t20150523T052453__w__\/us-en\/_acnmedia\/Accenture\/Conversion-Assets\/DotCom\/Documents\/Global\/PDF\/Strategy_3\/Accenture-Global-Consumer-Pulse-Research-Study-2013-Key-Findings.pdf\">biggest frustrations<\/a><strong>, <\/strong>are that<b> <\/b>websites\u00a0can&#8217;t answer their questions and\/or that they&#8217;re not responsive (mobile optimized). Both situations typically result in <strong>website abandonment,<\/strong>\u00a0many studies have proven that customers who have a bad service experience, <strong>visit a competitor<\/strong>\u2019s website. Bear in mind that it takes twelve positive customer<a href=\"https:\/\/www.helpscout.net\/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics\/\"> experiences<\/a> to make up for one negative one, these online businesses are unlikely to make it up to their customers&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>These are the reasons why, many businesses are doubling down on their efforts to provide a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/retail.economictimes.indiatimes.com\/re-tales\/the-big-trend-in-e-commerce-for-2016-care-for-your-customer\/1249\">superior level<\/a> of customer care. Findings from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bain.com\/Images\/BAIN_BRIEF_Putting_social_media_to_work.pdf\">Bain<\/a>, show that customer experience is expected to overtake price and product as a key brand differentiator, this explains that 89%<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>of online businesses are now competing mainly on<strong>\u00a0customer experience<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/customer-experience-1.jpg\" alt=\"customer experience\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Online businesses which focus on providing engaged, responsive customer service generally benefit from greater <strong>customer loyalty<\/strong>. Customers that come back, spend on average upwards of<strong> 20% &#8211; 40% more<\/strong> than first-time customers.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not all though! Here are four ways, ignoring your customers can hurt your online business. <strong>Big or small<\/strong>, this is what happens when they don\u2019t listen to customers and how<strong> customer feedback can help <\/strong>overcome those problems.<\/p>\n<h2>1- You lack a personal touch&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>Customers expect a <strong>customized approach<\/strong> from brands they purchase from, but delivering true personalization <strong>can be complicated<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The exact level and type of personalization is difficult to achieve since it varies from person to person. Do they prefer email discounts, pop-up offers, recommendations based on buying habits?<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/custom.jpg\" alt=\"custom\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Well&#8230;You&#8217;ll never know unless you ask them! Customer <strong>feedback surveys<\/strong> allow you to create personalized, unique, and <strong>optimized experiences<\/strong> for your customers, tailored for each of their individual preference. Actually, recent research has shown that, an increasing 50% of consumers\u00a0are willing to share their opinions if a business can make their lives easier through customized and <strong>omnichannel<\/strong> experiences.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to start paying attention to what makes them happy, nothing better than asking them yourself.<\/p>\n<h2>2- You\u2019re only focusing on desktop<\/h2>\n<p>Research shows <strong>mobile shopping<\/strong> accounts for nearly 1\/4 of online purchases.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartinsights.com\/mobile-marketing\/mobile-marketing-analytics\/mobile-marketing-statistics\/\">Smart Insights<\/a>, most of e-commerce traffic now comes from mobile and tablet. The reality is that mobile shopping is here to stay, in fact, Google has recently updated its rankings to prefer mobile-friendly sites and &#8220;punish&#8221; those who are not responsive.<\/p>\n<p>To attract customers and increase sales, implement responsiveness to your website and you can even take it to the next level by launching a mobile application for your store.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"1\" style=\"width: 650px;\" title=\"ecommerce bad performance\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/IMG-OGTCfr-21092017.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce bad performance\" longdesc=\"description longue\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;d better get on the mobile wagon quick, if you haven&#8217;t yet!<\/p>\n<p>Oh and by the way, mobile turns out to be a perfect way to deliver customer feedback surveys and\u00a0help you <strong>stay in touch<\/strong> with customers. Since people are constantly on their phones, it&#8217;s easier and more likely to get their feedback via this device.<\/p>\n<p class=\"discover_more\"><strong>Read more about <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/mobile-friendly-survey\/\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The benefits of designing mobile-friendly surveys.<\/span><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With social networking sites like Twitter and Instagram experiencing all-time high levels of popularity, customers are no strangers to <strong>expressing themselves<\/strong> in the moment.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a way to develop a unique advantage by gathering feedback in <strong>real time<\/strong> when the transaction is taking place, meaning it will be as accurate as possible.<\/p>\n<h2>3- You\u2019re overly attached to acquiring new customers<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.invespcro.com\/blog\/customer-acquisition-retention\/\">Some studies<\/a> estimate that it costs 5 -7 times more to acquire a customer than it does to retain an existing one.\u00a0 Given that increasing customer retention, by even just 5%, can increase profits by at least 25%, <strong>retaining existing customers<\/strong> simply makes <strong>better financial sense<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t establish a retention strategy now, your online store is likely to become less and less profitable. Of course, acquisition is always needed in e-commerce. But a smart online business will also <strong>focus heavily on retention<\/strong> so as to keep <strong>acquisition costs down<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" title=\"ecommerce bad performance\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/nurture.jpg\" alt=\"nurture\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The findings from a <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2002\/05\/how-surveys-influence-customers\/ar\/1\">Rice University study<\/a> show that simply asking customers what&#8217;s wrong, or what you could improve for them, is enough to maintain their <strong>engagement <\/strong>and happiness. Customers want to know that their opinions are valued by the companies with whom they chose to do business, for better or worse.<\/p>\n<p>It goes without saying that the happier the customer, the more likely he or she is to continue doing business with you. So customer feedback surveys are one way to help ensure<strong> happy customers<\/strong> that will stick with you.<\/p>\n<h2>4- You\u2019re not telling customers WHY they should shop with you<\/h2>\n<p>If it\u2019s important to retain existing customers, it is just as important for you to <strong>communicate<\/strong> to potential customers why your products will <strong>benefit them<\/strong>, and why they purchase these products from your website in particular.<\/p>\n<p>There are so many\u00a0e-commerce businesses, it\u2019s pretty easy to get lost in the crowd. Do you know <strong>what sets you apart<\/strong> from the competition? Clearly understanding and exploiting <strong>your value is key<\/strong> to stand out.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/unique.jpg\" alt=\"unique\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Asking for feedback on how customers view you, will allow you to find out what makes you better or not than the competition: selection? Customer service? Price?\u00a0<strong>Pinpoint what makes you unique<\/strong>, and highlight that value every time a visitor clicks on your site.<\/p>\n<h3>Case Study: J.
