Survey presentation can make or break how much time a consumer is willing to invest in a survey or how well they understand the survey in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>And while many decisions must be carefully considered when designing an effective survey, effective wording is at the top of the list.<\/p>\n<p>A well-worded survey makes respondents feel like they are helping themselves rather than completing a task which is a thankless infringement on their time and a waste of their energy.<\/p>\n<h2>Important writing tips to consider when wording your survey<\/h2>\n<h3>1. Clarity<\/h3>\n<p>The best surveys are clearly worded, clarifying what you want to find out, be it your customers likes, dislikes, or needs.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Every<\/strong> <strong>question should be designed to help you meet a specific objective<\/strong>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Word choice matters. Rating categories like \u201c<em>Excellent<\/em>\u201d or \u201c<em>Awesome<\/em>\u201d are, essentially, useless as \u201c<em>excellence<\/em>\u201d and \u201c<em>awesomeness<\/em>\u201d are pretty indefinable concepts.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, use language that cuts to the heart of each customer\u2019s experience. For example, try using emotive language like \u201c<em>Loved it!<\/em>\u201d as your top rating category.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Directness<\/h3>\n<p>Leading language will only frustrate respondents who will likely feel manipulated, forced to adopt a position with which they may not necessary agree.<\/p>\n<p>Questions which begin with \u201c<em>Wouldn\u2019t you like\u2026<\/em>\u201d or \u201c<em>Don\u2019t you agree\u2026<\/em>\u201d are clearly biased. \u201c<em>How easy was it to find what you were looking for?<\/em>\u201d forces respondents to answer according to a company\u2019s preconceived notion.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Maintain objectivity in your questions if you hope for objective responses from a customer<\/strong>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Another surefire way to frustrate a respondent is through the use of double negatives: \u201c<em>We were never not there for you when you needed us.<\/em>\u201d Customers will likely misinterpret questions like this which won\u2019t provide the useful feedback you seek.<\/p>\n<p>Yield precise answers by using precise language.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Simplicity<\/h3>\n<p>Increase response rates by avoiding language confusion. Although you are familiar with RSS, XML, and ISP, not all respondents will grasp this specialized language.<\/p>\n<p>On the surface, abbreviations would seem to increase response time but, in fact, they may end up slowing down the process.<\/p>\n<p>Remember: respondents come from all business and language backgrounds. Don\u2019t burden them with the hassle of Googling specialized or esoteric terms.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, avoid compound sentences and multiple clauses. Complicated grammar and sentence structure will only increase confusion and lag time in completion of a survey.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>The best surveys respect the respondent\u2019s time<\/strong>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Keep questions quick and concise, and avoid insider or overly academic language. You will see a correlation between the simplicity of your survey and response rates.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Tone<\/h3>\n<p>Satisfaction surveys create an opportunity to listen to customers and respond with solutions. The best approach is to sound human, finding the right balance between formal and casual.<\/p>\n<p>Treat the customer as a friend and a business partner. Customers want to know that a business cares about them, that there is a person in the company who will listen to them.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Accessible and humanizing language will ensure a higher completion rate.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Of course, you should avoid spelling errors and grammatical mistakes as they will only make your business appear unprofessional.<\/p>\n<p>But, at the same time, you might consider relaxing some grammatical standards for the sake of relatability.<\/p>\n<p>After all, in 2007, Boost Mobile got everyone asking \u201c<em>Where you at?<\/em>\u201d and we\u2019ve all been ending sentences with propositions ever since despite what our English teachers told us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Language choice is key to a successfully delivered survey.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Maintain your focus and remember that, no matter how you word your survey, every sentence must reinforce the same basic question: \u201c<em>How can we better serve you?<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--> <a href=\"http:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/744484\/f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"hs-cta-img-f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7.png\" alt=\"Download Ebook How Top Fortune 500 Companies Increased Their Performance Using Customer Feedback\" \/><\/a> <\/span> <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><br \/>\n<!--\/\/-->\/\/ ><!--\n\n        hbspt.cta.load(744484, 'f989b9a2-8fee-4398-a749-35bb6c7187a7', {});\n    \n\/\/--><!\n<\/script><\/span> <!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Satisfaction surveys work.
