Let\u2019s take a look back at their objectives, experience and future projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\"><strong>Norauto Decides to Focus on Customer Knowledge<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Norauto is the European leader in car maintenance and equipment and is an emblematic example of a major brand that has decided to focus on <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/redesign-customer-journey\/\">customer experience<\/a> to&nbsp;<strong>enrich its customer relationship and experience<\/strong>. Norauto called on Skeepers CX Management in 2017 to assist it in implementing a customer experience and satisfaction management programme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Norauto \u2013 Some Key Figures:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Company founded in 1970 in Lille.<\/li><li>More than 650 car centres in the world, including 408 in France.<\/li><li>6,500 employees in France and nearly 11,200 in the world.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/norauto-successful-customer-kowledge.jpg\" alt=\"norauto in the world\" class=\"wp-image-22522\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\"><strong>3 Concrete Needs for Norauto<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When the company initially contacted us, they shared&nbsp;<strong>3 concrete needs<\/strong>&nbsp;with us:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To adminster customer satisfaction surveys&nbsp;<strong>by email and on the Norauto website<\/strong>.<\/li><li>To create surveys with&nbsp;<strong>complex scenarios<\/strong>: targets, triggers, number of messages, etc.<\/li><li>To be&nbsp;<strong>autonomous and flexible<\/strong>&nbsp;when creating surveys.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This last point is key. It was important to Norauto that its internal teams could manage survey campaigns independently, from their creation to the targeting, results analysis and reporting. Before discovering&nbsp;Skeepers CX Management, Norauto had a customer data collection solution that was complex and not adapted to employee use. Flexibility and ease-of-use were two key criteria for Norauto when selecting their future customer knowledge solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Empowering our clients is at the heart of Skeepers CX Management\u2019s value proposition<\/strong>. We have developed a comprehensive, easy-to-use solution, with a user interface and features that are easy to understand. We provide our clients with support as the implement the service and a dedicated Customer Success Manager is available if needed. But our ultimate objective is to make our clients as autonomous as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping Norauto implement a Voice of the Client listening programme was particularly rewarding for us, given the challenges of this project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Skeepers CX Management solution was very easy to implement from an IT standpoint and our teams quickly learned how to use it, thanks to the support provided.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ga\u00eblle MBODJ&nbsp;\u2013 Customer Experience and Business Intelligence Manager.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\"><strong>The 3 Norauto Challenges in Terms of Customer Experience and Satisfaction Management<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge underlying the project was to improve the relevance of the solutions offered to customers, to further align Norauto products and services with customer needs and expectations. Norauto has fully understood that the sustainable improvement of customer satisfaction requires an enrichment of the knowledge of its customers and their personal needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The underlying challenge of this project was&nbsp;<strong>to improve the relevance of the customer solutions<\/strong>,&nbsp;to better align Norauto\u2019s products and services with its customers\u2019 needs and expectations. As Norauto fully understands, the sustainable improvement of customer satisfaction requires a better knowledge of customers and their personal needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first challenge was to deploy surveys by email and on the brand\u2019s website to better understand the customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Norauto also wanted to&nbsp;<strong>deploy solutions to measure awareness of their customer services<\/strong>. This was the second challenge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, the third was to&nbsp;<strong>build customer loyalty<\/strong>&nbsp;by encouraging customers to sign up to local Norauto events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Greater customer knowledge, greater product satisfaction knowledge, greater customer loyalty\u2026 These are all ambitious goals! So, how did Norauto successfully overcome these challenges? By deploying 3 types of survey campaigns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\"><strong>3 Types of Campaigns to Meet These Challenges<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Norauto has deployed 3 types of campaigns to meet these challenges:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Product <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/5-rules-of-logic-to-follow-for-your-surveys\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">surveys<\/a><\/strong>, commissioned by product managers or the marketing department. These surveys aim to measure customer satisfaction with Norauto products. The surveys are sent by email on a one-off basis after a customer makes a purchase online or at a car centre.<\/li><li><strong>Customer knowledge surveys<\/strong>. As the name suggests, these surveys aim to enrich Norauto\u2019s customer knowledge. The questions are based on:<ul><li>Customer satisfaction with regards to Norauto services.<\/li><li>Shopping habits: e.g., preferred visiting times.<\/li><li>The connection with the brand, with \u201cpsychographic\u201d questions about customers\u2019 values. The aim is to use these questions to highlight Norauto\u2019s own values, particularly those relating to sustainable development.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong>Registration campaigns for private Norauto events<\/strong>&nbsp;(\u201cauto malin\u201d courses, opening of a new centre, etc.) followed by surveys to measure post-event customer satisfaction. These event invitation campaigns meet the third challenge: building customer loyalty. Post-event surveys are used to measure the effectiveness of these offline campaigns.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/norauto-customer-kowledge-strategy.jpg\" alt=\"Customer knowledge survey\" class=\"wp-image-22521\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap5\"><strong>Norauto\u2019s Strategy Has Paid Off<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since implementing the surveys in 2017 and early 2020,&nbsp;<strong>Norauto has collected 34,000 customer responses via the Skeepers CX Management platform<\/strong>. This feedback and its analysis has enabled Norauto to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Rethink its products at all levels<\/strong>: packaging, design, use, etc. Online surveys have made it possible to identify any flaws in its product communication and to better understand its customers\u2019 purchasing behaviour: choice criteria, product use, etc.<\/li><li><strong>Optimise its merchandising policy through customer feedback following an in-store experience. Customer reviews have enabled Norauto to refocus its car centre staff\u2019s efforts on essential parts of the shopping journey, the moments of truth in the customer relationship. Resulting in significant time savings and increased efficiency.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap6\"><strong>How Norauto measures Employee Satisfaction<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve often talked about the importance of measuring employee satisfaction on our blog. There is a parallel between employee and customer satisfaction. This is known as the symmetry of attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Skeepers CX Management solution enables to measure both customer and employee satisfaction. Norauto seized this opportunity and decided to&nbsp;<strong>collect feedback from its 6,500 employees in France<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>These employee reviews enabled the brand to identify and deploy areas for improvement in the employee experience.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/norauto-customer-kowledge.jpg\" alt=\"norauto staff\" class=\"wp-image-22520\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap7\"><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\u2019s not all!&nbsp;<strong>Norauto has several projects in the pipeline<\/strong>&nbsp;for the near future:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Deploying surveys on their website to reach leads and identify the reasons for basket abandonment. In retail, handling shopping cart abandonment is key to improving conversion rates and increasing the number of online orders. Several of our clients use Skeepers CX Management surveys as online basket reminders (deployed in the form of an exit pop-up, for example).&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Translating existing campaigns into other languages&nbsp;<\/strong>in order to deploy them abroad. Skeepers CX Management has an automatic translation module for campaigns which saves a lot of time and other features to simplify the translation of surveys.<\/li><li><strong>Connecting CX Management and Adobe Campaign<\/strong>&nbsp;to enrich its <a href=\"https:\/\/searchcustomerexperience.techtarget.com\/definition\/CRM-customer-relationship-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CRM <\/a>\u2013 Marketing Automation solution with the collected answers, to then better segment its customer base (age groups, personas, etc.) and better target its marketing communications. Skeepers CX Management provides a native connector with Adobe Campaign to facilitate the interconnection of both systems and make Skeepers a CRM data source.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re delighted and proud to have helped Norauto successfully implement this transformation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Norauto has perfectly understood the benefits of customer knowledge.
