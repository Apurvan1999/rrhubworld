This requires the <strong>enhancement<\/strong> of their brand image.<\/p>\n<p>How do you <strong>generate a brand image<\/strong> that is valued and sustainable over time? The benefits of <strong>customer knowledge<\/strong> and <strong>surveys<\/strong> are amongst the elements not to be overlooked.<\/p>\n<h2>What determines a company\u2019s brand image?<\/h2>\n<p>Brand image refers to <strong>all the emotional representations<\/strong> and value judgements associated with a company or brand. Brand image can, as a concept, be compared to the notion of <strong>reputation<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The issue of brand image has become increasingly important in the marketing sector. For at least one simple reason; the economic world is dominated by often fierce <strong>competition<\/strong>. The number of \u201cofferors\u201d has increased significantly, in part due to globalisation.<\/p>\n<p>So, how do you capture <strong>such a competitive market<\/strong>? By projecting a quality brand image that makes it possible to <strong>positively differentiate yourself<\/strong> from competitors.<\/p>\n<p>Brand image can be built through <strong>intense media exposure<\/strong>, for example by investing huge sums of money in advertising. But this strategy is often based on <strong>elements that lack concrete information<\/strong> about the offer, and also lacks brand transparency, or doesn\u2019t reflect reality.<\/p>\n<p>One thing is certain, this is not within the reach of every company and ultimately, it is <strong>not the best way to build you brand image<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 433px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/build-brand-image.jpg\" alt=\"build-brand-image\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A company that invests millions in advertising but whose offer does not live up to its advertising promises will have <strong>difficulty building a sustainable brand image<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>The real determining factors of brand image<\/h3>\n<p>To build a sustainable brand image, a company must imperatively meet <strong>two conditions<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Offer products of quality<\/li>\n<li>Provide a quality service (in the broad sense)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In concrete terms, <strong>customer satisfaction contributes most<\/strong> to brand image, and if customers are satisfied, they could even become your best promoters by recommending you to others.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 346px;\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/brand-image-customer-satisfaction.jpg\" alt=\"brand-image-customer-satisfaction\" \/><\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em>For example, MyFeelBack offers the Net Promoter Score, to evaluate a customer\u2019s propensity to recommend you.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A company that sells quality products and provides an efficient service, will succeed in <strong>generating a positive reputation<\/strong> that, over time, will evolve into a <strong>brand image that is valued by all<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In the age of <strong>social media,<\/strong> where customers have a platform to express themselves, it is no longer possible to \u201clie\u201d to existing and potential customers, hence the <strong>secondary nature of advertising<\/strong> when creating a good brand image.<\/p>\n<h2>Building your brand image in a customer-centric perspective<\/h2>\n<p>You need to focus on customer satisfaction.
