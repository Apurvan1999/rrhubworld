But to collect actionable answers, it is really important to avoid biased questions. Here are a few examples of biased questions to never use in a customer survey.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Biased Questions Undermine your Customer Knowledge<\/h2>\n<p>Asking your customers questions helps you get to know them better: who they are, what they think of you, their expectations, etc. <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/customer-satisfaction-score-csat-how-to-use\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Satisfaction surveys<\/a> enable you to collect very useful information and to improve your offer and customer service.<\/p>\n<p>But this is only true if your questions are well phrased! If not, the result will be poorly qualified answers that are difficult to act on and interpret. You should therefore take all the time you need to build your survey and carefully phrase your questions.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we would like to draw your attention to so-called biased questions. A biased question is a question that steers the respondent\u2019s answer in a certain direction, sometimes deliberately but more often than not, unconsciously.<br \/>\nFor some, any question that doesn\u2019t provide satisfactory results is biased. In which case, lots of questions fall into the biased category.<\/p>\n<p>Biased questions are a problem in the sense that they undermine your answers. It\u2019s really important to avoid them. Your questions should remain as neutral as possible, so as to not influence your customers\u2019 choices.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to avoid biased questions is to look at a few examples.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Biased Questions that Explicitly Lead To an Answer<\/h2>\n<p>A rather crude example of a biased question, which fortunately is quite rare, is one that explicitly and deliberately leads the respondent to answer a certain way. For example:<br \/>\n&#8220;<em>Do you plan on buying a diesel car in the near future, bearing in mind that this type of vehicle pollutes more and that the price of diesel isn\u2019t that different to the price of ordinary petrol?<\/em>\u201dThe second part of the question clearly influences the respondent. In this example, the respondent is encouraged to say no. Sometimes, the question can lead to a yes, such as:<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Do you plan on buying an electric car in the near future, bearing in mind that this type of vehicle emits half the amount of CO2 and reduces your energy costs?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>2. Biased Questions that Value a Brand<\/h2>\n<p>Do you want to know what your customers think of your customer service? Then it would be a mistake to ask this type of question:<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Our customer service has been received several awards. Were you satisfied with our service and did we help you solve your problem?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This type of question encourages respondents to reply affirmatively. The person who wrote this question is clearly trying to get as many positive answers as possible, even if it means undermining the truthfulness of the answers. If you want to know what your customers really think, then avoid biased and embellished questions.<br \/>\nGenerally speaking, it is best to avoid superlatives and meliorative adjectives. Don\u2019t ask: \u201c<em>What do you think of our friendly customer service?<\/em>\u201d, but simply, \u201c<em>what do you think of our customer service?<\/em>\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more, read our article <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/ideas-satisfy-customers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">4 Simple Ideas to Quickly Satisfy your Customers<\/a>Even better, ask a targeted and precise question, such as: \u201c<em>Did you receive a quick answer?<\/em>\u201d. The more precise the question, the more useful the answers.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Closed Questions that Should be Open<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/examples.yourdictionary.com\/examples-of-open-ended-and-closed-ended-questions.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Closed questions<\/a>, as their name suggest, limit the respondent to a pre-determined choice of answers.<\/p>\n<p>In most cases, it makes sense to use closed questions. But sometimes, when the choice of answers could be very wide, using a closed question is a problem.<br \/>\nEven if you suggest 5 or 6 options, some customers might not relate to any of them.<\/p>\n<p>For example:<br \/>\n<em>What is your favourite brand?<\/em><br \/>\n<em>1. Audi 2. Renault 3. Fiat 4. Mercedes 5. Toyota<\/em><br \/>\nWhat if the respondent wanted to answer BMW? Either they won\u2019t answer at all or they will provide a wrong answer.A closed question is particularly problematic when it excludes real alternatives. When using a closed question, it is important to ensure that the answer options cover as many answers as possible.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>With regards to the example above, it would be better to:<\/li>\n<li>Ask an open-ended question.<\/li>\n<li>Rephrase the question: Which of these 5 brands do you prefer?<\/li>\n<li>Include a sixth answer choice, such as \u201cOther\u201d.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>4. Questions Biased by the Halo Effect<\/h2>\n<p>To fully understand the halo effect, let\u2019s take a look at the following example:<br \/>\nDo you agree with the reference magazine, PassionAuto, that our new car model is the best of the year?<\/p>\n<p>A halo effect occurs when an authoritative person or group is used to influence a question. This is also known as the contamination effect or the notoriety effect. The halo effect makes the answer less neutral. Respondents won\u2019t answer according to their own opinion, but according to that of the authoritative person.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Biased Questions that Ask Two Different Questions<\/h2>\n<p><em>How efficient and responsive did you find our customer service?<\/em><br \/>\nThis sort of split question makes it very difficult to interpret the results. Which part of the question does the client\u2019s answer refer to?<\/p>\n<h2>6. Questions that are Biased by a Lack of Clarity<\/h2>\n<p>This applies to any questions that use jargon and that are not easy to understand for all respondents.<br \/>\nE.g.: <em>What do you think of our new TSFI30D engine compared to the V6 BiTDI?<\/em>This question might make sense to a select few, but not necessarily to the general public. Make sure to adapt your vocabulary to your target audience.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Questions that are Biased by a Lack of Precision<\/h2>\n<p>Questions are considered vague when their answers are subject to interpretation.<br \/>\nE.g.: <em>Do you drive a lot?<\/em><br \/>\nHow many kilometres is &#8220;a lot&#8221;? It would be better to ask, &#8220;<em>Do you use your car every day?<\/em>\u201d or &#8220;<em>Do you drive more than 30,000 km per year?<\/em>\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, there are lots of ways to make questions biased, which is why it is so important to carefully phrase your questions.

The quality of your answers and the quality of your customer knowledge depends on your questions\u2019 impartiality.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Types of Questions to Avoid in a Survey October 1, 2021 The Types of Questions to Avoid in a Survey October 1, 2021Surveys are essential tools to enrich your CRM and measure customer satisfaction.
