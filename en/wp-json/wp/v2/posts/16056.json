In fact, for 35% of all Americans, mobile is their primary means for accessing the internet. For these reasons, 68% of marketers are using mobile surveys to engage customers since not doing so means missing out on one of the most effective ways to interact with customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Savvy marketers know that mobile optimized <a href=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/en\/blog\/why-and-how-use-ux-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">surveys<\/a> are a must if you are serious about gathering customer feedback and seeking insights into their behavior. Here are 5 reasons why mobile is such an effective platform for feedback surveys:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap1\"><strong>1. They are short <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/lydiadishman\/2014\/03\/07\/retailers-your-surveys-are-making-customers-suffer\/#16deb082581a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">52% of customers<\/a> say they will not spend more than three minutes filling out a survey, perhaps the reason why 80% of them have abandoned a survey halfway through. Mobile surveys are especially useful when it comes to keeping customers engaged as they ask \u2013 or should ask \u2013 fewer questions and allow for shorter responses. Because mobile devices are more difficult to type on, asking participants to respond at length to open-ended questions will only increase chances for respondent frustration and fatigue. Generally speaking, mobile surveys are short since more clicks equals more load time, with the wording of each question judiciously edited to just the basics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap2\"><strong>2. They are more convenient<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As of 2015, the number of daily hours people spend on their mobile device has officially topped the number of hours they spend watching television<a href=\"http:\/\/surveymagazine.org\/getting-getting-mobile-right\">.<\/a> Moreover, <a href=\"https:\/\/econsultancy.com\/blog\/62326-85-of-consumers-favour-apps-over-mobile-websites\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">as one study has found<\/a>, customers expect businesses to provide a mobile option for communicating with them. Overwhelmingly, they prefer mobile to desktop because they find mobile more convenient (according to 55% of respondents), faster (48% of respondents), and easier to browse (40% of respondents). Providing customers with a mobile-friendly survey shows that you understand their preferences and that you are flexible, prepared to offer the communication channel which works best for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap3\"><strong>3. They provide immediate feedback<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Real-time, \u201cin-the-moment\u201d feedback is the most effective feedback you can ask for. Asking customers to complete a mobile survey just after a transaction \u2013 a customer service interaction, a purchase, a delivery \u2013 ensures a greater chance that customers will complete your survey and that the feedback you receive is more specific and honest since the transaction is still fresh in your customers\u2019 minds. One study found that mobile responses were 26% more reliable than those given by online respondents. In addition, 49% of mobile surveys were completed within ten minutes of a transaction, compared to just 9% of online surveys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap4\"><strong>4. They are proactive<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>42% of people will tell their friends about a good customer experience on social, while 53% will talk about a bad one. One way to eliminate negative word-of-mouth is to provide your customers with more avenues to directly communicate their complaints to you before they go public. Mobile feedback surveys are an especially proactive means by which you can engage unhappy customers. While it\u2019s not always possible to prevent a frustrating experience, mobile-friendly customer feedback channels make it possible for you to take proactive steps to limit the damaging impact social complaining can have on your reputation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chap5\"><strong>5. They improve communication with your customers<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>68% of customers say they will leave a company because they believe it doesn\u2019t cares about them, making perceived indifference one of the top causes of customer abandonment. But mobile surveys ensure that you can easily stay in touch with your customers. Requesting their feedback will make them feel like their voice matters and, consequently, improve their perception of your business. And responding to the feedback \u2013 whether it is positive or negative \u2013with the promise to make concrete changes based on their insights can favorably shift your relationship with them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile-ready businesses not only build stronger relationships with customers but also develop a competitive market edge, taking advantage of customer-preferred communication channels to create a better all-around experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, mobile devices give companies many more capabilities beyond engineering surveys: push notifications, promotions, follow up text messages to thank customers for their business. They provide businesses with numerous ways to target, reach, and connect with customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But mobile surveys are particularly important because they place the customer at the forefront, inspiring (1) <strong>customer loyalty<\/strong>, allowing customers to connect directly and instantly with a business; (2) <strong>efficiency<\/strong>, requiring neither a great amount of customers\u2019 time nor energy; (3) <strong>a better customer experience<\/strong>, providing businesses with real-time data which they can rapidly respond to. In other words, mobile surveys differentiate, enabling a business stand out in today\u2019s crowded marketplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" id=\"hs-cta-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\">&lt;!&#8211;[if lte IE 8]&gt;<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>&lt;![endif]&#8211;&gt;<a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/20304540\/50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1\" style=\"border-width:0px\" height=\"223\" width=\"700\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1.png\" alt=\"15 questions to know your customers needs and expectations\"><\/a><\/span> hbspt.cta.load(20304540, &#8217;50ae5644-02d5-4330-9b0d-0e79812f8ce1&#8242;, {&#8220;useNewLoader&#8221;:&#8221;true&#8221;,&#8221;region&#8221;:&#8221;na1&#8243;}); <\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not all customer feedback surveys are created equal, but there is one thing you can do to make sure yours gets the responses you need to drive the customer experience you want to deliver.
