They get so caught up with everything else in company, that they end up <strong>overlooking<\/strong> the most important aspect of a business: <strong>happy customers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2- Customer Empowerment<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bezos declared early on, that Amazon would <strong>not simply sell <\/strong>stuff but \u201c<em>help customers make purchase decisions.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This attitude led to the key differentiator of allowing customers to post book <strong>reviews<\/strong> and, eventually, reviews of the entire range of products offered on the web site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Feedback<\/strong> is placed directly on the product\u2019s page and users are provided with multiples ways to parse the <strong>information<\/strong> to their liking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While customer reviews are seen everywhere today \u2013 Yelp, Uber, TripAdvisor \u2013 Amazon was the first to display such reviews, creating a more <strong>transparent e-retail space<\/strong> with two key benefits for the consumer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Prior to customer reviews, internet shoppers were essentially shopping in the dark, but thanks to Amazon the customer has readily <strong>available knowledge<\/strong> with which to make purchase decisions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manufacturers are now held even more <strong>accountable for the quality<\/strong> of their products, knowing that customers are sharing everything with one another.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>People like to know they are not being pushed into a decision, rather they are happy when provided will all informations so they can make their own decision and it&#8217;s your job as a company to help them with that, as Amazon did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/skeepers.io\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/amazon-Reviews.jpg\" alt=\"Customer Centric\" class=\"wp-image-18578\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s understandable to get cold sweats to the idea of <strong>detractors<\/strong> spoiling the image of your product or service through their reviews. But you&#8217;re also empowering your customers and increasing their trust in you, by giving free way to transparency and opinion. Don&#8217;t forget <strong>promotors<\/strong> are also out there if you make them satisfied.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3- Customer Loyalty<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon focuses on one simple measure of customer service quality: <strong>helpfulness<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They regularly <strong>interacts <\/strong>with customers through non-intrusive and easy-to-use<strong> satisfaction surveys<\/strong>.
