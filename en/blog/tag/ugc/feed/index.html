<p>We have some fantastic news to share with you today – Skeepers has officially acquired TokyWoky. This marks a significant chapter for us, strengthening our leadership in the User-Generated Content (UGC) space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While this is a significant moment for Skeepers, it&#8217;s equally thrilling for our customers worldwide. Together, we&#8217;re poised to tackle head-on the modern challenges of commerce, empowering global enterprises to foster communities of loyal consumers. Our goal is to help our customers create, collect, manage, and activate their UGC at scale while building loyalists around their brand.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="chap-1">Why Is this Acquisition Such a Game-Changer?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>TokyWoky specializes in building white-labeled customer communities for brands. These are digital platforms where brands can bring their best customers together to engage in discussion groups, contests, surveys, events, product tests, and even gamification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s about creating a closer bond with customers, enhancing their loyalty, and empowering them to produce authentic UGC.</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Imagine a bustling community hall where your consumers gather to share reviews, recommendations, and experiences about your brand. They find inspiration, get inspired, play games, earn rewards, and leave feeling happier about you. TokyWoky provides you with this platform to create a vibrant community experience, but digitally. Here&#8217;s how it works:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>Build Customer Communities:</strong></em> To put it simply, customer communities are essentially digital spaces that allow brands to bring together their top customers and engage with them through tools such as discussion groups, contests, surveys, events, product testing, and gamification, among other activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><em><strong>Reward Loyalty:</strong></em> By engaging consumers and offering them unique experiences, you can transform them into loyal fans who actively advocate for your brand. &nbsp;</li>



<li><em><strong>Generate non-stop UGC:</strong></em> Within these digital spaces, brands can effortlessly generate user-generated content (UGC) at scale. From DIY projects to showcasing favorite outfits, beauty routines, testimonials, and product photos, the audience is empowered to engage with the brand and contribute valuable content.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>With this, you not only increase product discovery, product page conversion, and total online revenue, but also leave your community feeling happy and positive about you.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:35px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="chap-2">The Power of Customer Communities&nbsp;</h2>



<p>&#8220;At Skeepers, we&#8217;ve seen firsthand how customer communities can make a big impact”, says Marc Bonnamour, CEO of Skeepers. He says, “working with our clients, we&#8217;ve noticed that 20% of customers bring in over 40% of revenue, while less than 5% create more than 80% of user-generated content (UGC). These loyal customers are extremely valuable to brands and retailers. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s crucial to nurture these key customers for organic growth. With our acquisition of TokyWoky, we&#8217;ve made it simpler to manage customer communities and generate UGC. This addition enhances our existing UGC one-stop-shop, making it easier for brands to build and manage their own communities, ultimately boosting both the quality and quantity of UGC they produce.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we welcome TokyWoky in our journey, here is what you, our customers, our partners, and our community should know:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Our Commitment</h3>



<p>At Skeepers, innovation is our cornerstone. It&#8217;s ingrained in our DNA and drives our continuous efforts to redefine how brands connect with consumers. We&#8217;re ready for substantial growth year after year, aiming to take TokyWoky&#8217;s innovation and customer-centricity to new heights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the following months, we&#8217;ll seamlessly integrate TokyWoky&#8217;s community management solution into our comprehensive UGC SaaS platform and incorporate it into our ongoing innovative R&amp;D initiatives. Our dedication to delivering value to our customers, and partners has only strengthened with the inclusion of TokyWoky.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:35px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="chap-3">The Future of our Solutions&nbsp;</h2>



<p>With TokyWoky now part of our team, we&#8217;re more equipped than ever to help brands unlock the full potential of their communities. This acquisition isn&#8217;t just about merging two companies; it&#8217;s about redefining how UGC is collected, created, managed, and activated at scale. Skeepers remains committed to generating authentic UGC at scale and we continue to offer and invest in this promise with our existing suite of solutions.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Meta now offers Facebook and Instagram users ad-free paid subscriptions. Meaning that the reach and performance of traditional advertising campaigns on these social media platforms will inevitably decrease in the coming months.</p>



<p>This revolution in the world of digital marketing is forcing brands to rethink their strategy and build new approaches to promoting their products on social media.</p>



<p>The solution to the fall of advertising? UGC (User Generated Content). Customer reviews, consumer videos, and posts by micro- and nano-influencers are becoming the main vectors for promoting products across all channels (websites, social media platforms, ad campaigns, etc.). Brands are using UGC more and more and this is only the beginning.</p>



<p>This article takes a look at Meta&#8217;s recent announcements and the new UGC trend.</p>



<div style="height:35px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="chap-1">Meta launches ad-free subscriptions on Facebook and Instagram</h2>



<p><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/10/facebook-and-instagram-to-offer-subscription-for-no-ads-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meta has officially unveiled ad-free paid subscriptions</a> for Facebook and Instagram. These plans will be rolled out in November in the European Economic Area and Switzerland (31 countries).</p>



<p>What is the main reason for this new policy? Regulatory compliance. Launching paid subscriptions enables Meta to align with a new European regulation coming into force on March 6, 2024 (Digital Market Act) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>



<div style="height:35px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="chap-2">The impact on consumers</h2>



<p>Consumers will have a choice: continue to use Facebook and Instagram for free with ads, or subscribe for an ad-free experience.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="373" height="825" src="https://skeepers.io/app/uploads/2023/12/facebook-ads-choices.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-138144" srcset="https://skeepers.io/app/uploads/2023/12/facebook-ads-choices.jpg 373w, https://skeepers.io/app/uploads/2023/12/facebook-ads-choices-136x300.jpg 136w, https://skeepers.io/app/uploads/2023/12/facebook-ads-choices-68x150.jpg 68w, https://skeepers.io/app/uploads/2023/12/facebook-ads-choices-27x60.jpg 27w, https://skeepers.io/app/uploads/2023/12/facebook-ads-choices-339x750.jpg 339w, https://skeepers.io/app/uploads/2023/12/facebook-ads-choices-226x500.jpg 226w, https://skeepers.io/app/uploads/2023/12/facebook-ads-choices-362x800.jpg 362w" sizes="(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Ad-free subscription window for Meta</em></figcaption></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>The monthly subscription price is set at €9.99</strong>. This price goes up to €12.99 per month if you subscribe on your mobile. This price difference is due to the fees charged by Apple and Google.</p>



<p>Subscriptions apply to user accounts, which are identified by an email address. Users who have the same Facebook and Instagram login won&#8217;t have to pay for two subscriptions.</p>



<div style="height:35px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="chap-3">The impact of this news on advertisers</h2>



<p><strong>The potential ad campaign audience on Instagram and Facebook will decrease</strong>, meaning that ads won&#8217;t reach as far or be as effective.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s difficult to estimate how many users will pay for these ad-free subscriptions, of course, but this is the main consequence for advertisers.</p>



<p>All advertisers will be impacted by the launch of ad-free subscriptions on Facebook and Instagram. Brands are facing a new challenge and need to explore new approaches. This is where User-Generated Content or UGC comes into play. Let&#8217;s take a look at how you can turn this seemingly bad news into a more effective acquisition strategy on social media.</p>



<div style="height:35px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="chap-4">Advertising is dead, long live UGC!</h2>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding UGC or User-Generated Content</h3>



<p><strong>UGC</strong>, or <a href="https://skeepers.io/en/blog/what-is-ugc-or-user-generated-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">User Generated Content</a>, refers to all content created by consumers about a brand or a product. UGC encompasses a wide array of formats, from texts, reviews, ratings, and comments, from consumer photos and videos posted on social media, to Live Shopping sessions…</p>



<p>UGC is a marketing strategy based on consumers&#8217; authenticity and spontaneity. This is their key strength and the main driver of their success.</p>



<p>Customers see UGC as <strong>more reliable and authentic</strong> than traditional marketing messages, creating a relationship of trust between brands and their audiences. This authenticity is particularly valuable today, when consumers are more and more skeptical of traditional ads, and listen even more to peer reviews.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been preaching the benefits for brands of investing in authentic content, rather than focusing on <strong>ad campaigns with an uncertain ROI</strong>, for several years now. Meta&#8217;s news only reinforces this message.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The rising power of UGC</h3>



<p>The rise in UGC is mainly due to changes in consumer behavior. Consumers today are tired of seeing ads everywhere. This advertising fatigue makes brand messages less impactful.</p>



<p>However, several figures show how important UGC has become in the purchasing process:</p>



<ul>
<li>8 out of 10 consumers say that UGC strongly influences their purchasing decisions (Source: <a href="https://www.blogdumoderateur.com/user-generated-content-enjeux-bonnes-pratiques-exemples-strategies-ugc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blog du Modérateur</a>).</li>



<li>88% of consumers check the product reviews before making a purchase.</li>



<li>UGC publications generate 6.9 times more engagement on social media platforms than brand publications.</li>
</ul>



<p>UGC is based on authentic and relevant content, which is an increasingly decisive factor for consumers.</p>



<p>Choosing UGC means opting for a more authentic and collaborative marketing style, that is more in tune with consumer expectations and, ultimately, more effective.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3 benefits of using UGC for brands</h3>



<p>Brands benefit in several ways by adopting UGC:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>UGC generates trust</strong>: using UGC is a powerful way of showing that the brand accepts both positive and negative feedback. This builds a relationship of trust with consumers, demonstrating that the brand values and respects all its customers&#8217; opinions.</li>



<li><strong>UGC generates engagement</strong>: UGC gets users actively involved with the brand. It fosters the creation of an engaged community. This ongoing interaction between brands and their audiences via UGC strengthens their relationship and can turn consumers into brand ambassadors.</li>



<li><strong>UGC boosts conversion</strong>: UGC has a direct impact on sales. As discussed above, it plays a key role in the buying journey. UGC is authentic, influencing consumer purchasing decisions more than traditional ads. By leveraging user-generated content, you can reduce your marketing costs while increasing your sales. The result? A much higher ROI than traditional advertising campaigns.</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4 tips for shaping your UGC marketing strategy</h3>



<p>There are several steps to follow when defining a UGC-focused marketing strategy on social media. We&#8217;re currently working on a guide detailing each of these steps, that we&#8217;ll publish shortly. Meanwhile, here are 4 tips for building your strategy:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Define and prioritize your goals</strong>: do you want to increase engagement? Promote your products? Create a community? Improve brand awareness? Start by clarifying and prioritizing your goals.</li>



<li><strong>Think omnichannel</strong>: UGC is not limited to social media. The content can be used on your website, in your communications, or in physical stores. Take the time to think about all the ways you can use UGC.</li>



<li><strong>Leverage the various social media platform formats</strong>: UGC (customer reviews or [consumer videos]) can be shared in stories, posts, and reels. Take advantage of these different formats and explore all the possibilities. Get familiar with Familiarize yourself with the basic codes and conventions of social media if you haven&#8217;t already.</li>



<li><strong>Choose the right tools</strong>: you need tools to encourage consumers to create content, monitor UGC, analyze it, and publish it. Skeepers offers several solutions centered around UGC management: Consumer Video to produce real consumer videos, Ratings &amp; Reviews to collect verified customer reviews about your brand and products, etc. Feel free to reach out to find out more.

</ul>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="chap-5">Conclusion</h2>



<p><strong>Meta&#8217;s introduction of ad-free subscription plans on Facebook and Instagram marks a turning point in the world of digital marketing</strong>. This development further reflects the decline of traditional advertising that is mirrored by the emergence of User Generated Content (UGC) as an alternative solution.</p>



<p>[UGC is emerging as a new driver of influence]. The UGC trend is a response to advertising overwhelm and modern consumers&#8217; search for authenticity. UGC&#8217;s influence on purchasing decisions has never been greater, and it&#8217;s growing all the time. And we believe that this is just the beginning.</p>



<p>Brands that know how to embrace UGC will pull ahead of the competition. We can help you make the most of User Generated Content. Feel free to contact us to share your challenges and find out more about our UGC solutions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="chap1">Transforming Trust Into Commerce</h2>



<p>Welcome to our brand-new brand. As we enter our next phase of growth, <strong>we’ve updated the Skeepers brand look</strong> and feel to better reflect our leadership position as the fully integrated one-stop-shop UGC suite.</p>



<p>You’ll see our fresh new logo and colors on our products, our <a href="https://skeepers.io/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Skeepers website</a>, and all of our branded collateral—and our new Avis Vérifiés website will launch early next year. We’re still the same Skeepers you know and trust to help your brand stand out, build customer trust, drive engagement, and boost your sales.</p>



<p><strong>Our innovative AI-based solutions</strong> continue to empower consumers, influencers and subject matter experts to become brand advocates and ambassadors, disrupting traditional marketing strategies and setting new standards in trust and consumer engagement across the pre- and post-sale phases of the consumer journey.</p>



<p>Consumer trust is&nbsp;the new currency in today’s world—and the voices and experiences of other consumers have become its gold standard. Shoppers today are not only more discerning, they’re also willing to do their homework. Insights and recommendations shared by fellow consumers hold far greater value than traditional advertising, with <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/study-user-generated-contents-influence-on-purchase-decisions-grows/445358/#:~:text=About%2090%25%20of%201%2C000%20shoppers%20recently%20surveyed%20say,commissioned%20by%20TurnTo%20Networks%2C%20a%20provider%20of%20content." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90% of consumers </a>saying user-generated content (UGC) influences their buying decisions.</p>



<p>Attention spans are shorter, media channels are more fragmented, saturated markets make it hard for brands to stand out, and online ad-blocking software and consumer avoidance of ads have made selling more challenging than ever. Ensuring you can effectively create, gather and leverage authentic UGC is not just valuable, it’s now imperative for business success. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="chap2">It’s Time To Get Real</h2>



<p>What real people authentically say about your brand and your products is now one of the most powerful influencing factors in consumer awareness, engagement, purchase, loyalty, and trust.&nbsp;<strong>Shoppers trust user-generated content&nbsp;6.6x more than branded content</strong>—making it the most trusted form of content for a business.</p>



<p>Harnessing the consumer voice might sound easy, but creating, collecting, managing, activating, and optimizing all the different types and formats of UGC at scale across all social platforms is complex, time consuming, expensive and an integration headache. Even if brands work with an agency, aside from the expense, the content won’t be authentic.</p>



<p>Skeepers makes all of this easy. <strong>Our multi-award winning full UGC solution suite</strong> offers a seamless one-stop shop that lets you flex, scale, and grow at your own speed—with Product Ratings and Reviews, Consumer Videos, Influencer Marketing, Live Shopping, Feedback Management and Customer Data Activation. We help brands get real with consumers through authenticity, efficiency, and proven results.</p>



<p>In just four years, we’ve become the established UGC leader in Europe and the UGC solution of choice for 8,000+ brands to create and collect, manage, activate, and optimize their UGC at scale. If you’ve been part of this momentum, I’d like to personally thank you for your support and for taking this journey with us. If you are just joining, buckle up for a great ride!</p>



<p><strong>Let’s get real together</strong> !</p>
